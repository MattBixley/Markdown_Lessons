abstract = {Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of whole genomes and exomes is a powerful tool in biomedical research and clinical diagnostics. However, the vast amount of data produced by NGS introduces new challenges and opportunities, many of which require novel computational and theoretical approaches when it comes to identifying the causal variant(s) for a disease of interest. While workflows and associated software to process raw data and produce high-confidence variant calls have significantly improved, filtering tens of thousands of candidates to identify a subset relevant to a specific study is still a complex exercise best left to bioinformaticists. However, as this prioritization procedure requires biological/biomedical reasoning, biologists and clinicians are increasingly motivated to handle the task themselves. Here, we describe a set of guidelines, tools, and online resources that can be used to identify functional variants from whole-genome and whole-exome variant calls and then prioritize these variants with potential associations to phenotypes of interest. Insights gained from a recently published analysis of protein-coding gene variation in {\textgreater}60,000 humans by the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) are also taken into account.},

abstract = {Deer farming is a significant international industry. For genetic improvement, using genomic tools, an ordered array of DNA variants and associated flanking sequence across the genome is required. This work reports a comparative assembly of the deer genome and subsequent DNA variant identification. Next generation sequencing combined with an existing bovine reference genome enabled the deer genome to be assembled sufficiently for large-scale SNP discovery. In total, 28 Gbp of sequence data were generated from seven Cervus elaphus (European red deer and Canadian elk) individuals. After aligning sequence to the bovine reference genome build UMD 3.0 and binning reads into one Mbp groups; reads were assembled and analyzed for SNPs. Greater than 99{\%} of the non-repetitive fraction of the bovine genome was covered by deer chromosomal scaffolds. We identified 1.8 million SNPs meeting Illumina InfiniumII SNP chip technical threshold. Markers on the published Red x Pere David deer linkage map were aligned to both UMD3.0 and the new deer chromosomal scaffolds. This enabled deer linkage groups to be assigned to deer chromosomal scaffolds, although the mapping locations remain based on bovine order. Genotyping of 270 SNPs on a Sequenom MS system showed that 88{\%} of SNPs identified could be amplified. Also, inheritance patterns showed no evidence of departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. A comparative assembly of the deer genome, alignment with existing deer genetic linkage groups and SNP discovery has been successfully completed and validated facilitating application of genomic technologies for subsequent deer genetic improvement.},

abstract = {Genomic prediction of breeding values from dense single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) genotypes is used for livestock and crop breeding, and can also be used to predict disease risk in humans. For some traits, the most accurate genomic predictions are achieved with non-linear estimates of SNP effects from Bayesian methods that treat SNP effects as random effects from a heavy tailed prior distribution. These Bayesian methods are usually implemented via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) schemes to sample from the posterior distribution of SNP effects, which is computationally expensive. Our aim was to develop an efficient expectation–maximisation algorithm (emBayesR) that gives similar estimates of SNP effects and accuracies of genomic prediction than the MCMC implementation of BayesR (a Bayesian method for genomic prediction), but with greatly reduced computation time. emBayesR is an approximate EM algorithm that retains the BayesR model assumption with SNP effects sampled from a mixture of normal distributions with increasing variance. emBayesR differs from other proposed non-MCMC implementations of Bayesian methods for genomic prediction in that it estimates the effect of each SNP while allowing for the error associated with estimation of all other SNP effects. emBayesR was compared to BayesR using simulated data, and real dairy cattle data with 632 003 SNPs genotyped, to determine if the MCMC and the expectation-maximisation approaches give similar accuracies of genomic prediction. We were able to demonstrate that allowing for the error associated with estimation of other SNP effects when estimating the effect of each SNP in emBayesR improved the accuracy of genomic prediction over emBayesR without including this error correction, with both simulated and real data. When averaged over nine dairy traits, the accuracy of genomic prediction with emBayesR was only 0.5{\%} lower than that from BayesR. However, emBayesR reduced computing time up to 8-fold compared to BayesR. The emBayesR algorithm described here achieved similar accuracies of genomic prediction to BayesR for a range of simulated and real 630 K dairy SNP data. emBayesR needs less computing time than BayesR, which will allow it to be applied to larger datasets.},

abstract = {Prediction of future phenotypes or genetic merit using high-density SNP chips can be used for prediction of disease risk in humans, for forensics, and for selection of livestock, crops, and forage species. Key questions are how accurately these predictions can be made and on what parameters does the accuracy depend. In this paper, we use three dairy cow traits?proportion of black on coat, fat percentage in milk, and overall type, which measures cow confirmation?to demonstrate the large differences among genetic architectures of complex traits. For example 24{\%} of the genetic variance in proportion of black is determined by three loci, KIT, MITF, and a locus on chromosome 8; however a surprisingly large number of additional loci, all of small effect, are required to capture the remaining variation. For overall type, a very large number of loci are necessary to capture the same level of variance. We also show that the accuracy of predicting genetic values is higher for traits with a proportion of large effects (proportion black and fat percentage) than for a trait with no loci of large effect (overall type), provided the method of analysis takes advantage of the distribution of loci effects.},

abstract = {KEY MESSAGE: Population structure must be evaluated before optimization of the training set population. Maximizing the phenotypic variance captured by the training set is important for optimal performance. The optimization of the training set (TRS) in genomic selection has received much interest in both animal and plant breeding, because it is critical to the accuracy of the prediction models. In this study, five different TRS sampling algorithms, stratified sampling, mean of the coefficient of determination (CDmean), mean of predictor error variance (PEVmean), stratified CDmean (StratCDmean) and random sampling, were evaluated for prediction accuracy in the presence of different levels of population structure. In the presence of population structure, the most phenotypic variation captured by a sampling method in the TRS is desirable. The wheat dataset showed mild population structure, and CDmean and stratified CDmean methods showed the highest accuracies for all the traits except for test weight and heading date. The rice dataset had strong population structure and the approach based on stratified sampling showed the highest accuracies for all traits. In general, CDmean minimized the relationship between genotypes in the TRS, maximizing the relationship between TRS and the test set. This makes it suitable as an optimization criterion for long-term selection. Our results indicated that the best selection criterion used to optimize the TRS seems to depend on the interaction of trait architecture and population structure.},

abstract = {Whole-genome enabled prediction of complex traits has received enormous attention in animal and plant breeding and is making inroads into human and even Drosophila genetics. The term "Bayesian alphabet" denotes a growing number of letters of the alphabet used to denote various Bayesian linear regressions that differ in the priors adopted, while sharing the same sampling model. We explore the role of the prior distribution in whole-genome regression models for dissecting complex traits in what is now a standard situation with genomic data where the number of unknown parameters (p) typically exceeds sample size (n). Members of the alphabet aim to confront this overparameterization in various manners, but it is shown here that the prior is always influential, unless n ≫ p. This happens because parameters are not likelihood identified, so Bayesian learning is imperfect. Since inferences are not devoid of the influence of the prior, claims about genetic architecture from these methods should be taken with caution. However, all such procedures may deliver reasonable predictions of complex traits, provided that some parameters ("tuning knobs") are assessed via a properly conducted cross-validation. It is concluded that members of the alphabet have a room in whole-genome prediction of phenotypes, but have somewhat doubtful inferential value, at least when sample size is such that n ≪ p.},

abstract = {Genomic prediction involves characterization of chromosome fragments in a training population to predict merit. Confidence in the predictions relies on their evaluation in a validation population. Many commercial animals are multibreed (MB) or crossbred, but seedstock populations tend to be purebred (PB). Training in MB allows selection of PB for crossbred performance. Training in PB to predict MB performance quantifies the potential for across-breed genomic prediction. Efficiency of genomic selection was evaluated for a trait with heritability 0.5 simulated using actual SNP genotypes. The PB population had 1,086 Angus animals, and the MB population had 924 individuals from 8 sire breeds. Phenotypic values were simulated for scenarios including 50, 100, 250, or 500 additive QTL randomly selected from 50K SNP panels. Panels containing various numbers of SNP, including or excluding the QTL, were used in the analysis. A Bayesian model averaging method was used to simultaneously estimate the effects of all markers on the panels in MB (or PB) training populations. Estimated effects were utilized to predict genomic merit of animals in PB (or MB) validation populations. Correlations between predicted and simulated genomic merit in the validation population was used to reflect predictive ability. Panels that included QTL were able to account for 50{\%} or more of the within-breed genetic variance when the trait was influenced by 50 QTL. The predictive power eroded as the number of QTL increased. Panels that composed the QTL and no other markers were able to account for 50{\%} or more genetic variance even with 500 QTL. Panels that included genomic markers as well as QTL had less predictive power as the number of markers on the panel was increased. Panels that excluded the QTL and relied on markers in linkage disequilibrium (LD) to predict QTL effects performed more poorly than marker panels with QTL. Real-life situations with 50K panels that excluded the QTL could account for no more than 20{\%} genetic variation for 50 QTL and less than 10{\%} for 500 QTL. The difference between panels that included and excluded QTL indicates that the predictive ability of existing panels is limited by their LD. Training in PB to predict MB tended to be more predictive than training in MB to predict PB due to greater average levels of LD in PB than in MB populations. Improved across breed prediction of genomic merit will require panels with more than 50,000 markers.},

abstract = {KEY MESSAGE: Models based on additive marker effects and on epistatic interactions can be translated into genomic relationship models. This equivalence allows to perform predictions based on complex gene interaction models and reduces computational effort significantly. In the theory of genome-assisted prediction, the equivalence of a linear model based on independent and identically normally distributed marker effects and a model based on multivariate Gaussian distributed breeding values with genomic relationship as covariance matrix is well known. In this work, we demonstrate equivalences of marker effect models incorporating epistatic interactions and corresponding mixed models based on relationship matrices and show how to exploit these equivalences computationally for genome-assisted prediction. In particular, we show how models with epistatic interactions of higher order (e.g., three-factor interactions) translate into linear models with certain covariance matrices and demonstrate how to construct epistatic relationship matrices for the linear mixed model, if we restrict the model to interactions defined a priori. We illustrate the practical relevance of our results with a publicly available data set on grain yield of wheat lines growing in four different environments. For this purpose, we select important interactions in one environment and use this knowledge on the network of interactions to increase predictive ability of grain yield under other environmental conditions. Our results provide a guide for building relationship matrices based on knowledge on the structure of trait-related gene networks.},

The objective of this study was to investigate efficient computing options to create relationship matrices based on genomic markers and pedigree information as well as their inverses. SNP maker information was simulated for a panel of 40 K SNPs, with the number of genotyped animals up to 30 000. Matrix multiplication in the computation of the genomic relationship was by a simple ‘do' loop, by two optimized versions of the loop, and by a specific matrix multiplication subroutine. Inversion was by a generalized inverse algorithm and by a LAPACK subroutine. With the most efficient choices and parallel processing, creation of matrices for 30 000 animals would take a few hours. Matrices required to implement a unified approach can be computed efficiently. Optimizations can be either by modifica- tions of existing code or by the use of efficient automatic optimizations provided by open source or third-party libraries. Introduction},

abstract = {Several genome wide selection (GWS) statistical methods have been proposed in the last years, and among these stands out the Bayesian LASSO (BL), which is a penalized regression method based on the regularization parameter ($\lambda$) estimates. In general, the posterior mean values for $\lambda$ are those that minimize the residual sum of squares (RSS) while controlling the L1 norm (absolute values) of the regression coefficients. However, another option is to use fixed values of $\lambda$, which is independent of this minimization process. Nevertheless, the most important aim of GWS is to make predictions about genomic breeding values (GBV = u) for individuals that have not been measured directly for the trait, and for this reason the parameter to maximize should be the accuracy (ru,{\^{u}}). Thus, a question can arise as to whether such estimated $\lambda$ values that minimize RSS are the same as that which maximize ru,{\^{u}}. In order to answer this question, this paper aims to provide methodological and computational resources in order to evaluate the influence of BL regularization parameter estimates on the correlation between true and estimated GBV (accuracy) depending on genetic structure of the target trait (few or many QTLs and low or medium heritability). In general, it is possible to report, on average, that GBV prediction is robust in relation to the $\lambda$ estimation, since the different values for $\lambda$ lead to similar accuracy values. Moreover, the fixed $\lambda$ values grid request high computational costs, implying that the random $\lambda$ method is more attractive, since it is much faster to use just one Gibbs sampler run, while the grid must to use one run for each fixed $\lambda$ value. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Glucocorticoid (GC) resistance can occur in a number of diseases. It can be either generalized (i.e., familial glucocorticoid resistance) or localized (i.e., asthma). In many cases, a reason for this resistance to steroids lies with mutations or polymorphisms present in the glucocorticoid receptor gene (GR/NR3C1) that belongs to a large family of nuclear receptors. A number of GC-resistant cell lines have been isolated in vitro, some of which arose or may have arisen in vivo. These and the mutations defined in them are included in this review as well as mutations engineered in plasmids and expressed in vitro. It also lists polymorphisms and the individual studies where association-related studies have been performed. NR3C1 is located on chromosome 5q31 and contains 10 exons that code for a 777 amino acid protein. There are two naturally occurring isoforms of the NR3C1, GRalpha (functional) and GRbeta (no hormone-binding ability). A total of 15 missense, three nonsense, three frameshift, one splice site, and two alternative spliced mutations have been reported in the NR3C1 gene associated with glucocorticoid resistance as well as 16 polymorphisms. Mutation and polymorphism data for NR3C1 will soon be found on the newly created locus-specific database.},

abstract = {Many important traits in plant breeding are polygenic and therefore recalcitrant to traditional marker-assisted selection. Genomic selection addresses this complexity by including all markers in the prediction model. A key method for the genomic prediction of breeding values is ridge regression (RR), which is equivalent to best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) when the genetic covariance between lines is proportional to their similarity in genotype space. This additive model can be broadened to include epistatic effects by using other kernels, such as the Gaussian, which represent inner products in a complex feature space. To facilitate the use of RR and nonadditive kernels in plant breeding, a new software package for R called rrBLUP has been developed. At its core is a fast maximum-likelihood algorithm for mixed models with a single variance component besides the residual error, which allows for effi cient prediction with unreplicated training data. Use of the rrBLUP software is demonstrated through several examples, including the identifi cation of optimal crosses based on superior progeny value. In cross-validation tests, the prediction accuracy with nonadditive kernels was signifi cantly higher than RR for wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grain yield but equivalent for several maize (Zea mays L.) traits.},

abstract = {Despite rapid advances in genomic technology, our ability to account for phenotypic variation using genetic information remains limited for many traits. This has unfortunately resulted in limited application of genetic data towards preventive and personalized medicine, one of the primary impetuses of genome-wide association studies. Recently, a large proportion of the "missing heritability" for human height was statistically explained by modeling thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms concurrently. However, it is currently unclear how gains in explained genetic variance will translate to the prediction of yet-to-be observed phenotypes. Using data from the Framingham Heart Study, we explore the genomic prediction of human height in training and validation samples while varying the statistical approach used, the number of SNPs included in the model, the validation scheme, and the number of subjects used to train the model. In our training datasets, we are able to explain a large proportion of the variation in height (h(2) up to 0.83, R(2) up to 0.96). However, the proportion of variance accounted for in validation samples is much smaller (ranging from 0.15 to 0.36 depending on the degree of familial information used in the training dataset). While such R(2) values vastly exceed what has been previously reported using a reduced number of pre-selected markers ({\textless}0.10), given the heritability of the trait (∼ 0.80), substantial room for improvement remains.},

abstract = {Genomic selection (GS) uses molecular breeding values (MBV) derived from dense markers across the entire genome for selection of young animals. The accuracy of MBV prediction is important for a successful application of GS. Recently, several methods have been proposed to estimate MBV. Initial simulation studies have shown that these methods can accurately predict MBV. In this study we compared the accuracies and possible bias of five different regression methods in an empirical application in dairy cattle. Genotypes of 7,372 SNP and highly accurate EBV of 1,945 dairy bulls were used to predict MBV for protein percentage (PPT) and a profit index (Australian Selection Index, ASI). Marker effects were estimated by least squares regression (FR-LS), Bayesian regression (Bayes-R), random regression best linear unbiased prediction (RR-BLUP), partial least squares regression (PLSR) and nonparametric support vector regression (SVR) in a training set of 1,239 bulls. Accuracy and bias of MBV prediction were calculated from cross-validation of the training set and tested against a test team of 706 young bulls. For both traits, FR-LS using a subset of SNP was significantly less accurate than all other methods which used all SNP. Accuracies obtained by Bayes-R, RR-BLUP, PLSR and SVR were very similar for ASI (0.39-0.45) and for PPT (0.55-0.61). Overall, SVR gave the highest accuracy. All methods resulted in biased MBV predictions for ASI, for PPT only RR-BLUP and SVR predictions were unbiased. A significant decrease in accuracy of prediction of ASI was seen in young test cohorts of bulls compared to the accuracy derived from cross-validation of the training set. This reduction was not apparent for PPT. Combining MBV predictions with pedigree based predictions gave 1.05 - 1.34 times higher accuracies compared to predictions based on pedigree alone. Some methods have largely different computational requirements, with PLSR and RR-BLUP requiring the least computing time. The four methods which use information from all SNP namely RR-BLUP, Bayes-R, PLSR and SVR generate similar accuracies of MBV prediction for genomic selection, and their use in the selection of immediate future generations in dairy cattle will be comparable. The use of FR-LS in genomic selection is not recommended.},

abstract = {Background: Hyperuricemia (HUA) contributes to gout and many other diseases. Many hyperuricemia-related risk factors have been discovered, which provided the possibility for building the hyperuricemia prediction model. In this study we aimed to explore the incidence of hyperuricemia and develop hyperuricemia prediction models based on the routine biomarkers for both males and females in urban Han Chinese adults. Methods: A cohort of 58,542 members of the urban population (34,980 males and 23,562 females) aged 20–80 years old, free of hyperuricemia at baseline examination, was followed up for a median 2.5 years. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to develop gender-specific prediction models. Harrell's C-statistics was used to evaluate the discrimination ability of the models, and the 10-fold cross-validation was used to validate the models. Results: In 7139 subjects (5585 males and 1554 females), hyperuricemia occurred during a median of 2.5 years of follow-up, leading to a total incidence density of 49.63/1000 person years (64.62/1000 person years for males and 27.12/1000 person years for females). The predictors of hyperuricemia were age, body mass index (BMI) systolic blood pressure, serum uric acid for males, and BMI, systolic blood pressure, serum uric acid, triglycerides for females. The models' C statistics were 0.783 (95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 0.779–0.786) for males and 0.784 (95{\%} CI, 0.778–0.789) for females. After 10-fold cross-validation, the C statistics were still steady, with 0.782 for males and 0.783 for females. Conclusions: In this study, gender-specific prediction models for hyperuricemia for urban Han Chinese adults were developed and performed well.},

abstract = {Type 2 diabetes mellitus results from the interaction of environmental factors with a combination of genetic variants, most of which were hitherto unknown. A systematic search for these variants was recently made possible by the development of high-density arrays that permit the genotyping of hundreds of thousands of polymorphisms. We tested 392,935 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in a French case–control cohort. Markers with the most significant difference in genotype frequencies between cases of type 2 diabetes and controls were fast-tracked for testing in a second cohort. This identified four loci containing variants that confer type 2 diabetes risk, in addition to confirming the known association with the TCF7L2 gene. These loci include a non-synonymous polymorphism in the zinc transporter SLC30A8, which is expressed exclusively in insulin-producing b-cells, and two linkage disequilibrium blocks that contain genes potentially involved in b-cell development or function (IDE–KIF11–HHEX and EXT2–ALX4). These associations explain a substantial portion of disease risk and constitute proof of principle for the genome-wide approach to the elucidation of complex genetic traits. The rapidly increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is thought to be due to environmental factors, such as increased availabil-ity of food and decreased opportunity and motivation for physical activity, acting on genetically susceptible individuals. The heritability of T2DM is one of the best established among common diseases and, consequently, genetic risk factors for T2DM have been the subject of intense research 1},

abstract = {The advent of high throughput sequencing technology has enabled the 1000 Genomes Project Pilot 3 to generate complete sequence data for more than 906 genes and 8,140 exons representing 697 subjects. The 1000 Genomes database provides a critical opportunity for further interpreting disease associations with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) discovered from genetic association studies. Currently, direct sequencing of candidate genes or regions on a large number of subjects remains both cost- and time-prohibitive. To accelerate the translation from discovery to functional studies, we propose an in silico gene sequencing method (ISS), which predicts phased sequences of intragenic regions, using SNPs. The key underlying idea of our method is to infer diploid sequences (a pair of phased sequences/alleles) at every functional locus utilizing the deep sequencing data from the 1000 Genomes Project and SNP data from the HapMap Project, and to build prediction models using flanking SNPs. Using this method, we have developed a database of prediction models for 611 known genes. Sequence prediction accuracy for these genes is 96.26{\%} on average (ranges 79{\%}-100{\%}). This database of prediction models can be enhanced and scaled up to include new genes as the 1000 Genomes Project sequences additional genes on additional individuals. Applying our predictive model for the KCNJ11 gene to the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) Type 2 diabetes cohort, we demonstrate how the prediction of phased sequences inferred from GWAS SNP genotype data can be used to facilitate interpretation and identify a probable functional mechanism such as protein changes. Prior to the general availability of routine sequencing of all subjects, the ISS method proposed here provides a time- and cost-effective approach to broadening the characterization of disease associated SNPs and regions, and facilitating the prioritization of candidate genes for more detailed functional and mechanistic studies.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper was to develop statistical models to estimate individual breed composition based on the previously proposed idea of regressing discrete random variables corresponding to counts of reference alleles of biallelic molecular markers located across the genome on the allele frequencies of each marker in the pure (base) breeds. Some of the existing regression-based methods do not guarantee that estimators of breed composition will lie in the appropriate parameter space and none of them accounts for uncertainty about allele frequencies in the pure breeds, that is, uncertainty about the design matrix. In order to overcome these limitations, we proposed two Bayesian generalized linear models. For each individual, both models assume that the counts of the reference allele at each marker locus follow independent Binomial distributions, use the logit link, and pose a Dirichlet prior over the vector of regression coefficients (which corresponds to breed composition). This prior guarantees that point estimators of breed composition like the posterior mean pertain to the appropriate space. The difference between these models is that model termed BIBI does not account for uncertainty about the design matrix, while model termed BIBI2 accounts for such an uncertainty by assigning independent Beta priors to the entries of this matrix. We implemented these models in a multibreed Angus-Brahman population. Posterior means were used as point estimators of breed composition. In addition, the ordinary least squares estimator proposed by Kuehn et al. (2011) (OLSK) was also computed. BIBI and BIBI2 estimated breed composition more accurately than OLSK, and BIBI2 had an 8.3{\%} improvement in accuracy as compared to BIBI.},

abstract = {Predicting the accuracy of estimated genomic values using genome-wide marker information is an important step in designing training populations. Currently, different deterministic equations are available to predict accuracy within populations, but not for multi-population scenarios where data from multiple breeds, lines or environments is combined. Therefore, our objective was to develop and validate a deterministic equation to predict the accuracy of genomic values when different populations are combined in one training population. The input parameters of the derived prediction equation are the number of individuals and the heritability from each of the populations in the training population, the genetic correlations between the populations, i.e., the correlation between allele substitution effects of quantitative trait loci, the effective number of chromosome segments across predicted and training populations, and the proportion of the genetic variance in the predicted population captured by the markers in each of the training populations. Validation was performed based on real genotype information of 1033 Holstein Friesian cows that were divided in three different populations by combining half-sib families in the same population. Phenotypes were simulated for multiple scenarios, differing in heritability within populations and in genetic correlations between the populations. Results showed that the derived equation can accurately predict the accuracy of estimating genomic values for different scenarios of multi-population genomic prediction. Therefore, the derived equation can be used to investigate the potential accuracy of different multi-population genomic prediction scenarios and to decide on the most optimal design of training populations.},

abstract = {Whole-genome regression methods are being increasingly used for the analysis and prediction of complex traits and diseases. In human genetics, these methods are commonly used for inferences about genetic parameters, such as the amount of genetic variance among individuals or the proportion of phenotypic variance that can be explained by regression on molecular markers. This is so even though some of the assumptions commonly adopted for data analysis are at odds with important quantitative genetic concepts. In this article we develop theory that leads to a precise definition of parameters arising in high dimensional genomic regressions; we focus on the so-called genomic heritability: the proportion of variance of a trait that can be explained (in the population) by a linear regression on a set of markers. We propose a definition of this parameter that is framed within the classical quantitative genetics theory and show that the genomic heritability and the trait heritability parameters are equal only when all causal variants are typed. Further, we discuss how the genomic variance and genomic heritability, defined as quantitative genetic parameters, relate to parameters of statistical models commonly used for inferences, and indicate potential inferential problems that are assessed further using simulations. When a large proportion of the markers used in the analysis are in LE with QTL the likelihood function can be misspecified. This can induce a sizable finite-sample bias and, possibly, lack of consistency of likelihood (or Bayesian) estimates. This situation can be encountered if the individuals in the sample are distantly related and linkage disequilibrium spans over short regions. This bias does not negate the use of whole-genome regression models as predictive machines; however, our results indicate that caution is needed when using marker-based regressions for inferences about population parameters such as the genomic heritability.},

In addition, the sheer number of variants makes analysis of all variants and accurate estimation of all effects computationally challenging. Our objective was to find a strategy to approximate the analysis of whole-sequence data with a Bayesian variable selection model. Using a simulated dataset, we applied a Bayes R hybrid model to analyse whole-sequence data, test the effect of dropping a proportion of variants during the analysis, and test how the analysis can be split into separate analyses per chromosome to reduce the elapsed computing time. We also investigated the effect of imputation errors on prediction accuracy. Subsequently, we applied the approach to a dataset that contained imputed sequences and records for production and fertility traits for 38,492 Holstein, Jersey, Australian Red and crossbred bulls and cows. With the simulated dataset, we found that prediction accuracy was highly increased for a breed that was not represented in the training population for sequence data compared to HD SNP data. Either dropping part of the variants during the analysis or splitting the analysis into separate analyses per chromosome decreased accuracy compared to analysing whole-sequence data. First, dropping variants from each chromosome and reanalysing the retained variants together resulted in an accuracy similar to that obtained when analysing whole-sequence data. Adding imputation errors decreased prediction accuracy, especially for errors in the validation population. With real data, using sequence variants resulted in accuracies that were similar to those obtained with the HD SNPs. We present an efficient approach to approximate analysis of whole-sequence data with a Bayesian variable selection model. The lack of increase in prediction accuracy when applied to real data could be due to imputation errors, which demonstrates the importance of developing more accurate methods of imputation or directly genotyping sequence variants that have a major effect in the prediction equation.},

abstract = {Many modern genomic data analysis require implementing regressions where the number of parameters (p, e.g., the number of marker effects) exceeds sample size (n). Implementing these large-p-with-small-n regressions poses several statistical and computational challenges, some of which can be confronted using Bayesian methods. This approach allows integrating various parametric and non-parametric shrinkage and variable selection procedures in a unified and consistent manner. The BGLR R-package implements a large collection Bayesian regression models, including parametric variable selection and shrinkage methods and semi-parametric procedures (Bayesian reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces regressions, RKHS). The software was originally developed for genomic applications; however, the methods implemented are useful for many non-genomic applications as well. The response can be continuous (censored or not) or categorical (either binary, or ordinal). The algorithm is based on a Gibbs Sampler with scalar updates and the implementation takes advantage of efficient compiled C and Fortran routines. In this article we describe the methods implemented in BGLR, present examples of the use of the package and discuss practical issues emerging in real-data analysis.},

abstract = {In recent years, there has been a considerable amount of research on the use of regularization methods for inference and prediction in quantitative genetics. Such research mostly focuses on selection of markers and shrinkage of their effects. In this review paper, the use of ridge regression for prediction in quantitative genetics using single-nucleotide polymorphism data is discussed. In particular, we consider (i) the theoretical foundations of ridge regression, (ii) its link to commonly used methods in animal breeding, (iii) the computational feasibility, and (iv) the scope for constructing prediction models with nonlinear effects (e.g., dominance and epistasis). Based on a simulation study we gauge the current and future potential of ridge regression for prediction of human traits using genome-wide SNP data. We conclude that, for outcomes with a relatively simple genetic architecture, given current sample sizes in most cohorts (i.e., N {\textless} 10,000) the predictive accuracy of ridge regression is slightly higher than the classical genome-wide association study approach of repeated simple regression (i.e., one regression per SNP). However, both capture only a small proportion of the heritability. Nevertheless, we find evidence that for large-scale initiatives, such as biobanks, sample sizes can be achieved where ridge regression compared to the classical approach improves predictive accuracy substantially.},

It is based on the following principle: When the effective number of breeders (Neb) in a population is small, the allele frequencies will (by chance) be different in males and females, which causes an excess of heterozygotes in the progeny with respect to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium expectations. We evaluate the accuracy and precision of the heterozygote-excess method using empirical and simulated data sets from polygamous, polygynous, and monogamous mating systems and by using realistic sample sizes of individuals (15-120) and loci (5-30) with varying levels of polymorphism. The method gave nearly unbiased estimates of Neb under all three mating systems. However, the confidence intervals on the point estimates of Neb were sufficiently small (and hence the heterozygote-excess method useful) only in polygamous and polygynous populations that were produced by {\textless}10 effective breeders, unless samples included {\textgreater} approximately 60 individuals and 20 multiallelic loci.},

abstract = {Animals can be genotyped for thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at one time, where the SNPs are located at roughly 1-cM intervals throughout the genome. For each contiguous pair of SNPs there are four possible haplotypes that could be inherited from the sire. The effects of each interval on a trait can be estimated for all intervals simultaneously in a model where interval effects are random factors. Given the estimated effects of each haplotype for every interval in the genome, and given an animal's genotype, a 'genomic' estimated breeding value is obtained by summing the estimated effects for that genotype. The accuracy of that estimator of breeding values is around 80{\%}. Because the genomic estimated breeding values can be calculated at birth, and because it has a high accuracy, a strategy that utilizes these advantages was compared with a traditional progeny testing strategy under a typical Canadian-like dairy cattle situation. Costs of proving bulls were reduced by 92{\%} and genetic change was increased by a factor of 2. Genome-wide selection may become a popular tool for genetic improvement in livestock.},

abstract = {We compared the accuracies of four genomic-selection prediction methods as affected by marker density, level of linkage disequilibrium (LD), quantitative trait locus (QTL) number, sample size, and level of replication in populations generated from multiple inbred lines. Marker data on 42 two-row spring barley inbred lines were used to simulate high and low LD populations from multiple inbred line crosses: the first included many small full-sib families and the second was derived from five generations of random mating. True breeding values (TBV) were simulated on the basis of 20 or 80 additive QTL. Methods used to derive genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) were random regression best linear unbiased prediction (RR-BLUP), Bayes-B, a Bayesian shrinkage regression method, and BLUP from a mixed model analysis using a relationship matrix calculated from marker data. Using the best methods, accuracies of GEBV were comparable to accuracies from phenotype for predicting TBV without requiring the time and expense of field evaluation. We identified a trade-off between a method's ability to capture marker-QTL LD vs. marker-based relatedness of individuals. The Bayesian shrinkage regression method primarily captured LD, the BLUP methods captured relationships, while Bayes-B captured both. Under most of the study scenarios, mixed-model analysis using a marker-derived relationship matrix (BLUP) was more accurate than methods that directly estimated marker effects, suggesting that relationship information was more valuable than LD information. When markers were in strong LD with large-effect QTL, or when predictions were made on individuals several generations removed from the training data set, however, the ranking of method performance was reversed and BLUP had the lowest accuracy.},

abstract = {Common diseases such as type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease result from a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors. Recent developments in genomics research have boosted progress in the discovery of susceptibility genes and fueled expectations about opportunities of genetic profiling for personalizing medicine. Personalized medicine requires a test that fairly accurately predicts disease risk, particularly when interventions are invasive, expensive or have major side effects. Recent studies on the prediction of common diseases based on multiple genetic variants alone or in addition to traditional disease risk factors showed limited predictive value so far, but all have investigated only a limited number of susceptibility variants. New gene discoveries from genome-wide association studies will certainly further improve the prediction of common diseases, but the question is whether this improvement is sufficient to enable personalized medicine. In this paper, we argue that new gene discoveries may not evidently improve the prediction of common diseases to a degree that it will change the management of individuals at increased risk. Substantial improvements may only be expected if we manage to understand the complete causal mechanisms of common diseases to a similar extent as we understand those of monogenic disorders. Genomics research will contribute to this understanding, but it is likely that the complexity of complex diseases may ultimately limit the opportunities for accurate prediction of disease in asymptomatic individuals as unraveling their complete causal pathways may be impossible.},

abstract = {Hierarchical mixed effects models have been demonstrated to be powerful for predicting genomic merit of livestock and plants, on the basis of high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) marker panels, and their use is being increasingly advocated for genomic predictions in human health. Two particularly popular approaches, labeled BayesA and BayesB, are based on specifying all SNP-associated effects to be independent of each other. BayesB extends BayesA by allowing a large proportion of SNP markers to be associated with null effects. We further extend these two models to specify SNP effects as being spatially correlated due to the chromosomally proximal effects of causal variants. These two models, that we respectively dub as ante-BayesA and ante-BayesB, are based on a first-order nonstationary antedependence specification between SNP effects. In a simulation study involving 20 replicate data sets, each analyzed at six different SNP marker densities with average LD levels ranging from r(2) = 0.15 to 0.31, the antedependence methods had significantly (P {\textless} 0.01) higher accuracies than their corresponding classical counterparts at higher LD levels (r(2) {\textgreater} 0. 24) with differences exceeding 3{\%}. A cross-validation study was also conducted on the heterogeneous stock mice data resource (http://mus.well.ox.ac.uk/mouse/HS/) using 6-week body weights as the phenotype. The antedependence methods increased cross-validation prediction accuracies by up to 3.6{\%} compared to their classical counterparts (P {\textless} 0.001). Finally, we applied our method to other benchmark data sets and demonstrated that the antedependence methods were more accurate than their classical counterparts for genomic predictions, even for individuals several generations beyond the training data.},

abstract = {The success of genomic selection depends on the potential to predict genome-assisted breeding values (GEBVs) with high accuracy over several generations without additional phenotyping after estimating marker effects. Results from both simulations and practical applications have to be evaluated for this potential, which requires linkage disequilibrium (LD) between markers and QTL. This study shows that markers can capture genetic relationships among genotyped animals, thereby affecting accuracies of GEBVs. Strategies to validate the accuracy of GEBVs due to LD are given. Simulations were used to show that accuracies of GEBVs obtained by fixed regression-least squares (FR-LS), random regression-best linear unbiased prediction (RR-BLUP), and Bayes-B are nonzero even without LD. When LD was present, accuracies decrease rapidly in generations after estimation due to the decay of genetic relationships. However, there is a persistent accuracy due to LD, which can be estimated by modeling the decay of genetic relationships and the decay of LD. The impact of genetic relationships was greatest for RR-BLUP. The accuracy of GEBVs can result entirely from genetic relationships captured by markers, and to validate the potential of genomic selection, several generations have to be analyzed to estimate the accuracy due to LD. The method of choice was Bayes-B; FR-LS should be investigated further, whereas RR-BLUP cannot be recommended.},

Genomic selection is expected to be particularly valuable for traits that are costly to phenotype and expressed late in the life cycle of long-lived species. Alternative approaches to genomic selection prediction models may perform differently for traits with distinct genetic properties. Here the performance of four different original methods of genomic selection that differ with respect to assumptions regarding distribution of marker effects, including (i) ridge regression-best linear unbiased prediction (RR-BLUP), (ii) Bayes A, (iii) Bayes C$\pi$, and (iv) Bayesian LASSO are presented. In addition, a modified RR-BLUP (RR-BLUP B) that utilizes a selected subset of markers was evaluated. The accuracy of these methods was compared across 17 traits with distinct heritabilities and genetic architectures, including growth, development, and disease-resistance properties, measured in a Pinus taeda (loblolly pine) training population of 951 individuals genotyped with 4853 SNPs. The predictive ability of the methods was evaluated using a 10-fold, cross-validation approach, and differed only marginally for most method/trait combinations. Interestingly, for fusiform rust disease-resistance traits, Bayes C$\pi$, Bayes A, and RR-BLUB B had higher predictive ability than RR-BLUP and Bayesian LASSO.

Here, we present LDlink, a web-based collection of bioinformatic modules that query single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in population groups of interest to generate haplotype tables and interactive plots. Modules are designed with an emphasis on ease of use, query flexibility, and interactive visualization of results. Phase 3 haplotype data from the 1000 Genomes Project are referenced for calculating pairwise metrics of LD, searching for proxies in high LD, and enumerating all observed haplotypes. LDlink is tailored for investigators interested in mapping common and uncommon disease susceptibility loci by focusing on output linking correlated alleles and highlighting putative functional variants.

abstract = {Despite important advances from Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS), for most complex human traits and diseases, a sizable proportion of genetic variance remains unexplained and prediction accuracy (PA) is usually low. Evidence suggests that PA can be improved using Whole-Genome Regression (WGR) models where phenotypes are regressed on hundreds of thousands of variants simultaneously. The Genomic Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (G-BLUP, a ridge-regression type method) is a commonly used WGR method and has shown good predictive performance when applied to plant and animal breeding populations. However, breeding and human populations differ greatly in a number of factors that can affect the predictive performance of G-BLUP. Using theory, simulations, and real data analysis, we study the performance of G-BLUP when applied to data from related and unrelated human subjects. Under perfect linkage disequilibrium (LD) between markers and QTL, the prediction R-squared (R(2)) of G-BLUP reaches trait-heritability, asymptotically. However, under imperfect LD between markers and QTL, prediction R(2) based on G-BLUP has a much lower upper bound. We show that the minimum decrease in prediction accuracy caused by imperfect LD between markers and QTL is given by (1-b)(2), where b is the regression of marker-derived genomic relationships on those realized at causal loci. For pairs of related individuals, due to within-family disequilibrium, the patterns of realized genomic similarity are similar across the genome; therefore b is close to one inducing small decrease in R(2). However, with distantly related individuals b reaches very low values imposing a very low upper bound on prediction R(2). Our simulations suggest that for the analysis of data from unrelated individuals, the asymptotic upper bound on R(2) may be of the order of 20{\%} of the trait heritability. We show how PA can be enhanced with use of variable selection or differential shrinkage of estimates of marker effects.},

abstract = {Estimated breeding values (EBVs) using data from genetic markers can be predicted using a genomic relationship matrix, derived from animal's genotypes, and best linear unbiased prediction. However, if the accuracy of the EBVs is calculated in the usual manner (from the inverse element of the coefficient matrix), it is likely to be overestimated owing to sampling errors in elements of the genomic relationship matrix. We show here that the correct accuracy can be obtained by regressing the relationship matrix towards the pedigree relationship matrix so that it is an unbiased estimate of the relationships at the QTL controlling the trait. This method shows how the accuracy increases as the number of markers used increases because the regression coefficient (of genomic relationship towards pedigree relationship) increases. We also present a deterministic method for predicting the accuracy of such genomic EBVs before data on individual animals are collected. This method estimates the proportion of genetic variance explained by the markers, which is equal to the regression coefficient described above, and the accuracy with which marker effects are estimated. The latter depends on the variance in relationship between pairs of animals, which equals the mean linkage disequilibrium over all pairs of loci. The theory was validated using simulated data and data on fat concentration in the milk of Holstein cattle.},

abstract = {Genomic selection refers to the use of dense markers covering the whole genome to estimate the breeding value of selection candidates for a quantitative trait. This paper considers prediction of breeding value based on a linear combination of the markers. In this case the best estimate of each marker's effect is the expectation of the effect conditional on the data. To calculate this requires a prior distribution of marker effects. If the marker effects are normally distributed with constant variance, BLUP can be used to calculate the estimated effects of the markers and hence the estimated breeding value (EBV). In this case the model is equivalent to a conventional animal model in which the relationship matrix among the animals is estimated from the markers instead of the pedigree. The accuracy of the EBV can approach 1.0 but a very large amount of data is required. An alternative model was investigated in which only some markers have non-zero effects and these effects follow a reflected exponential distribution. In this case the expected effect of a marker is a non-linear function of the data such that apparently small effects are regressed back almost to zero and consequently these markers can be deleted from the model. The accuracy in this case is considerably higher than when marker effects are normally distributed. If genomic selection is practiced for several generations the response declines in a manner that can be predicted from the marker allele frequencies. Genomic selection is likely to lead to a more rapid decline in the selection response than phenotypic selection unless new markers are continually added to the prediction of breeding value. A method to find the optimum index to maximise long term selection response is derived. This index varies the weight given to a marker according to its frequency such that markers where the favourable allele has low frequency receive more weight in the index.},

abstract = {Genetic risk scores are an increasingly popular tool for summarizing the cumulative risk of a set of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) with disease. Typically only the set of the SNPs that have reached genome-wide significance compose these scores. However recent work suggests that including additional SNPs may aid risk assessment. In this paper, we used the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study cohort to illustrate how one can choose the optimal set of SNPs for a genetic risk score (GRS). In addition to P-value threshold, we also examined linkage disequilibrium, imputation quality, and imputation type. We provide a variety of evaluation metrics. Results suggest that P-value threshold had the greatest impact on GRS quality for the outcome of coronary heart disease, with an optimal threshold around 0.001. However, GRSs are relatively robust to both linkage disequilibrium and imputation quality. We also show that the optimal GRS partially depends on the evaluation metric and consequently the way one intends to use the GRS. Overall the implications highlight both the robustness of GRS and a means to empirically choose the best set of GRSs.},

The causation of most common human diseases is complex , being influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors 1 . The development of genome - wide association studies (GWAS) has allowed the detection of many genetic variants associated with these diseases . However , these variants only explain a fraction of the herit - ability estimated in previous family - based studies , and hence there is a missing heritability that remains unidentified 2 . One possible explanation for this missing heritability is that previous heritability estimates could be inflated because family environmental effects were not specified in the model or because these effects could not be esti - mated owing to study design 3 . Furthermore , comparisons of heritability explained by SNPs identified through GWAS or the hidden heritabil - ity estimated from genome - wide arrays (that is , SNP heritability that captures the contribution of common variants , including those not yet detected as having genome - wide significant association with dis - ease owing to lack of power) with published estimates of heritability present some important challenges . For instance , the populations from which family - based heritability estimates were obtained may differ from those used in the GWAS in definition or prevalence of disease or in genetic background . These , and other factors 3 , make assessments of heritability estimates for disease from familial studies and GWAS difficult and in some instances inappropriate . The objective of the current study was to estimate the heritability of 12 complex human diseases using self - reported personal and family history of disease in 1 , 555 , 906 white European participants and relatives from the UK Biobank , which comprise over 2{\%} of the UK population .

UK Biobank partici - pants were measured for multiple traits and questioned about their lifestyle , environmental risk factors and medical history ; they gave their informed consent for participation following strict protocols 5 . Here we use information from the family disease history reported by participants to estimate the heritability and the environmental contributions to the liability of 12 broadly defined complex diseases : heart disease , stroke , chronic bronchitis , hypertension , diabetes , Alzheimer ' s disease , Parkinson ' s disease , severe depression , and lung , bowel , prostate and breast cancers (Supplementary Table 1) . The accuracy of self - reported health status was assessed and is discussed in the Supplementary Note and Supplementary Tables 2 and 3 .

In this article we go back to the basics and build a Bayesian multilocus association model for quantitative and binary traits with carefully defined hierarchical parameterization of Student's t and Laplace priors. In this treatment we consider alternative model structures, using indicator variables and polygenic terms.

abstract = {BLUP (best linear unbiased prediction) is widely used to predict complex traits in plant and animal breeding, and increasingly in human genetics. The BLUP mathematical model, which consists of a single random effect term, was adequate when kinships were measured from pedigrees. However, when genome-wide SNPs are used to measure kinships, the BLUP model implicitly assumes that all SNPs have the same effect-size distribution, which is a severe and unnecessary limitation. We propose MultiBLUP, which extends the BLUP model to include multiple random effects, allowing greatly improved prediction when the random effects correspond to classes of SNPs with distinct effect-size variances. The SNP classes can be specified in advance, for example, based on SNP functional annotations, and we also provide an adaptive procedure for determining a suitable partition of SNPs. We apply MultiBLUP to genome-wide association data from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (seven diseases), and from much larger studies of celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease, finding that it consistently provides better prediction than alternative methods. Moreover, MultiBLUP is computationally very efficient; for the largest data set, which includes 12,678 individuals and 1.5 M SNPs, the total analysis can be run on a single desktop PC in less than a day and can be parallelized to run even faster. Tools to perform MultiBLUP are freely available in our software LDAK.},

abstract = {The study of continuously varying, quantitative traits is important in evolutionary biology, agriculture, and medicine. Variation in such traits is attributable to many, possibly interacting, genes whose expression may be sensitive to the environment, which makes their dissection into underlying causative factors difficult. An important population parameter for quantitative traits is heritability, the proportion of total variance that is due to genetic factors. Response to artificial and natural selection and the degree of resemblance between relatives are all a function of this parameter. Following the classic paper by R. A. Fisher in 1918, the estimation of additive and dominance genetic variance and heritability in populations is based upon the expected proportion of genes shared between different types of relatives, and explicit, often controversial and untestable models of genetic and non-genetic causes of family resemblance. With genome-wide coverage of genetic markers it is now possible to estimate such parameters solely within families using the actual degree of identity-by-descent sharing between relatives. Using genome scans on 4,401 quasi-independent sib pairs of which 3,375 pairs had phenotypes, we estimated the heritability of height from empirical genome-wide identity-by-descent sharing, which varied from 0.374 to 0.617 (mean 0.498, standard deviation 0.036). The variance in identity-by-descent sharing per chromosome and per genome was consistent with theory. The maximum likelihood estimate of the heritability for height was 0.80 with no evidence for non-genetic causes of sib resemblance, consistent with results from independent twin and family studies but using an entirely separate source of information. Our application shows that it is feasible to estimate genetic variance solely from within-family segregation and provides an independent validation of previously untestable assumptions. Given sufficient data, our new paradigm will allow the estimation of genetic variation for disease susceptibility and quantitative traits that is free from confounding with non-genetic factors and will allow partitioning of genetic variation into additive and non-additive components.},

Gene-based analysis identified associations of functional rare variants in three genes with eGFRcrea, including a novel association with the SOS Ras/Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 2 gene, SOS2 (P=5.4×10(-8) by sequence kernel association test). Experimental follow-up in zebrafish embryos revealed changes in glomerular gene expression and renal tubule morphology in the embryonic kidney of acp1- and sos2-knockdowns. These developmental abnormalities associated with altered blood clearance rate and heightened prevalence of edema. This study expands the number of loci associated with kidney function and identifies novel genes with potential roles in kidney formation.},

We evaluated 119,629 SNPs in the GWAS and 161 SNPs (in 29 mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation genes) in the candidate association study. Top hits from GWAS and the candidate gene study were selected to compute weighted genetic risk scores (wGRS). Linear regression models were used to calculate effect size estimates and related nominal p-values. The top hit in our GWAS was chr19:51063065 in FOXA3 (empirical p-value = 2.20e-6). A total of 134 SNPs had p-values {\textless} 0.001 including rs17111633 in CNNM1 (p-value = 6.32e-6) and chr19:51083059 in MYPOP (p-value = 3.23e-5). In the candidate association study, several SNPs in PPARG, PRKCA, SP1, and THRB were associated with mtDNA copy number (p-values {\textless} 0.05). mtDNA copy number was significantly associated with wGRS based on top GWAS hits ($\beta$ =0.49, 95{\%} CI:0.38-0.60, p {\textless} 0.001).

abstract = {The rapid increase in high-throughput single-nucleotide polymorphism data has led to a great interest in applying genome-wide evaluation methods to identify an individual's genetic merit. Genome-wide evaluation combines statistical methods with genomic data to predict genetic values for complex traits. Considerable uncertainty currently exists in determining which genome-wide evaluation method is the most appropriate. We hypothesize that genome-wide methods deal differently with the genetic architecture of quantitative traits and genomes. A genomic linear method (GBLUP), and a genomic nonlinear Bayesian variable selection method (BayesB) are compared using stochastic simulation across three effective population sizes and a wide range of numbers of quantitative trait loci (N(QTL)). GBLUP had a constant accuracy, for a given heritability and sample size, regardless of N(QTL). BayesB had a higher accuracy than GBLUP when N(QTL) was low, but this advantage diminished as N(QTL) increased and when N(QTL) became large, GBLUP slightly outperformed BayesB. In addition, deterministic equations are extended to predict the accuracy of both methods and to estimate the number of independent chromosome segments (M(e)) and N(QTL). The predictions of accuracy and estimates of M(e) and N(QTL) were generally in good agreement with results from simulated data. We conclude that the relative accuracy of GBLUP and BayesB for a given number of records and heritability are highly dependent on M(e,) which is a property of the target genome, as well as the architecture of the trait (N(QTL)).},

The last decade has seen the discovery of thousands of genetic variants that confer greater risk for various common diseases, such as cancer and heart disease. While this has been a breakthrough for medical research, what implications does it pose for life insurance? The ability for individuals to learn more about their long-term health based on a genetic test raises the prospect of greater anti-selection risks. To help life insurers navigate this new landscape, here we summarise the latest in genetics research as it relates to predicting individual disease risk and analyse the potential impact of genetic testing on the industry. We show that genetic risk prediction is already powerful, but will only become a potential material threat if, or when, such testing becomes more widespread. Finally, we explore some ideas on how we can think differently about evolving the practice of life insurance to cope with greater personal knowledge.},

@article{Spencer2009,
abstract = {Genome-wide association studies are revolutionizing the search for the genes underlying human complex diseases. The main decisions to be made at the design stage of these studies are the choice of the commercial genotyping chip to be used and the numbers of case and control samples to be genotyped. The most common method of comparing different chips is using a measure of coverage, but this fails to properly account for the effects of sample size, the genetic model of the disease, and linkage disequilibrium between SNPs. In this paper, we argue that the statistical power to detect a causative variant should be the major criterion in study design. Because of the complicated pattern of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in the human genome, power cannot be calculated analytically and must instead be assessed by simulation. We describe in detail a method of simulating case-control samples at a set of linked SNPs that replicates the patterns of LD in human populations, and we used it to assess power for a comprehensive set of available genotyping chips. $\backslash$nOur results allow us to compare the performance of the chips to detect variants with different effect sizes and allele frequencies, look at how power changes with sample size in different populations or when using multi-marker tags and genotype imputation approaches, and how performance compares to a hypothetical chip that contains every SNP in HapMap. A main conclusion of this study is that marked differences in genome coverage may not translate into appreciable differences in power and that, when taking budgetary considerations into account, the most powerful design may not always correspond to the chip with the highest coverage. We also show that genotype imputation can be used to boost the $\backslash$npower of many chips up to the level obtained from a hypothetical ‘‘complete'' chip containing all the SNPs in HapMap. Our results have been encapsulated into an R software package that allows users to design future association studies and our methods provide a framework with which new chip sets can be evaluated.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Recent genome-wide association studies have identified multiple novel loci associated with obesity in Europeans. We hypothesized that these genetic variants may be associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) in Chinese. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We examined 14 associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms at 12 loci (NEGR1, SEC16B, TMEM18, ETV5/DGKG, GNPDA2, LIN7C/BDNF, MTCH2, BCDIN3D/FAIM2, SH2B1, FTO, MC4R, and KCTD15) in 605 healthy adults, 1087 healthy adolescents and 6013 T2D patients from Hong Kong. RESULTS The European at-risk alleles at five loci including GNPDA2, BCDIN3D/FAIM2, SH2B1, FTO, and KCTD15 were significantly associated with increased body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (4.5 x 10(-8) {\textless} P {\textless} 0.024), and/or obesity risk (odds ratio 1.14-1.22, 2.0 x 10(-5) {\textless} P {\textless} 0.002) in our Chinese populations. The former four loci as well as LIN7C/BDNF were also modestly associated with T2D risk (odds ratio 1.09-1.22, 0.008 {\textless} P {\textless} 0.041), but the associations were lost after adjustment for BMI, suggesting their roles in T2D risk are mediated through modulation of adiposity. Joint effect analyses of the five adiposity loci revealed an increase of about 0.29 kg/m(2) in BMI with each additional copy of at-risk allele (P(trend) = 4.2 x 10(-12)). CONCLUSIONS Our findings support the important contribution of GNPDA2, BCDIN3D/FAIM2, SH2B1, FTO, and KCTD15 in the regulation of adiposity, which in turn affects T2D risk in Chinese.},

Moreover, script based environments like R may not be able to handle large-scale genomic data or exploit model properties which save computing time or memory (RAM). RESULTS BESSiE is a software designed for best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) and Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis of linear mixed models allowing for continuous and/or categorical multivariate, repeated and missing observations, various random and fixed factors and large-scale genomic marker data.

We apply the method to simulated data of quantitative traits and Welcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) data on disease and show that it provides accurate estimates of SNP-based heritability, produces unbiased estimators of risk in new samples, and that it can estimate genetic architecture by partitioning variation across hundreds to thousands of SNPs. We estimated that, depending on the trait, 2,633 to 9,411 SNPs explain all of the SNP-based heritability in the WTCCC diseases. The majority of those SNPs ({\textgreater}96{\%}) had small effects, confirming a substantial polygenic component to common diseases. The proportion of the SNP-based variance explained by large effects (each SNP explaining 1{\%} of the variance) varied markedly between diseases, ranging from almost zero for bipolar disorder to 72{\%} for type 1 diabetes. Prediction analyses demonstrate that for diseases with major loci, such as type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis, Bayesian methods outperform profile scoring or mixed model approaches.},

abstract = {Genomic best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) is a statistical method that uses relationships between individuals calculated from single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to capture relationships at quantitative trait loci (QTL). We show that genomic BLUP exploits not only linkage disequilibrium (LD) and additive-genetic relationships, but also cosegregation to capture relationships at QTL. Simulations were used to study the contributions of those types of information to accuracy of genomic estimated breeding values (GEBVs), their persistence over generations without retraining, and their effect on the correlation of GEBVs within families. We show that accuracy of GEBVs based on additive-genetic relationships can decline with increasing training data size and speculate that modeling polygenic effects via pedigree relationships jointly with genomic breeding values using Bayesian methods may prevent that decline. Cosegregation information from half sibs contributes little to accuracy of GEBVs in current dairy cattle breeding schemes but from full sibs it contributes considerably to accuracy within family in corn breeding. Cosegregation information also declines with increasing training data size, and its persistence over generations is lower than that of LD, suggesting the need to model LD and cosegregation explicitly. The correlation between GEBVs within families depends largely on additive-genetic relationship information, which is determined by the effective number of SNPs and training data size. As genomic BLUP cannot capture short-range LD information well, we recommend Bayesian methods with t-distributed priors.},

abstract = {Prediction of genetic values is a central problem in quantitative genetics. Over many decades, such predictions have been successfully accomplished using information on phenotypic records and family structure usually represented with a pedigree. Dense molecular markers are now available in the genome of humans, plants and animals, and this information can be used to enhance the prediction of genetic values. However, the incorporation of dense molecular marker data into models poses many statistical and computational challenges, such as how models can cope with the genetic complexity of multi-factorial traits and with the curse of dimensionality that arises when the number of markers exceeds the number of data points. Reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces regressions can be used to address some of these challenges. The methodology allows regressions on almost any type of prediction sets (covariates, graphs, strings, images, etc.) and has important computational advantages relative to many parametric approaches. Moreover, some parametric models appear as special cases. This article provides an overview of the methodology, a discussion of the problem of kernel choice with a focus on genetic applications, algorithms for kernel selection and an assessment of the proposed methods using a collection of 599 wheat lines evaluated for grain yield in four mega environments.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dense SNP genotypes are often combined with complex trait phenotypes to map causal variants, study genetic architecture and provide genomic predictions for individuals with genotypes but no phenotype. A single method of analysis that jointly fits all genotypes in a Bayesian mixture model (BayesR) has been shown to competitively address all 3 purposes simultaneously. However, BayesR and other similar methods ignore prior biological knowledge and assume all genotypes are equally likely to affect the trait. While this assumption is reasonable for SNP array genotypes, it is less sensible if genotypes are whole-genome sequence variants which should include causal variants.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We introduce a new method (BayesRC) based on BayesR that incorporates prior biological information in the analysis by defining classes of variants likely to be enriched for causal mutations. The information can be derived from a range of sources, including variant annotation, candidate gene lists and known causal variants. This information is then incorporated objectively in the analysis based on evidence of enrichment in the data. We demonstrate the increased power of BayesRC compared to BayesR using real dairy cattle genotypes with simulated phenotypes. The genotypes were imputed whole-genome sequence variants in coding regions combined with dense SNP markers. BayesRC increased the power to detect causal variants and increased the accuracy of genomic prediction. The relative improvement for genomic prediction was most apparent in validation populations that were not closely related to the reference population. We also applied BayesRC to real milk production phenotypes in dairy cattle using independent biological priors from gene expression analyses. Although current biological knowledge of which genes and variants affect milk production is still very incomplete, our results suggest that the new BayesRC method was equal to or more powerful than BayesR for detecting candidate causal variants and for genomic prediction of milk traits.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: BayesRC provides a novel and flexible approach to simultaneously improving the accuracy of QTL discovery and genomic prediction by taking advantage of prior biological knowledge. Approaches such as BayesRC will become increasing useful as biological knowledge accumulates regarding functional regions of the genome for a range of traits and species.},

abstract = {This is the first large-scale experimental study on genome-based prediction of testcross values in an advanced cycle breeding population of maize. The study comprised testcross progenies of 1,380 doubled haploid lines of maize derived from 36 crosses and phenotyped for grain yield and grain dry matter content in seven locations. The lines were genotyped with 1,152 single nucleotide polymorphism markers. Pedigree data were available for three generations. We used best linear unbiased prediction and stratified cross-validation to evaluate the performance of prediction models differing in the modeling of relatedness between inbred lines and in the calculation of genome-based coefficients of similarity. The choice of similarity coefficient did not affect prediction accuracies. Models including genomic information yielded significantly higher prediction accuracies than the model based on pedigree information alone. Average prediction accuracies based on genomic data were high even for a complex trait like grain yield (0.72-0.74) when the cross-validation scheme allowed for a high degree of relatedness between the estimation and the test set. When predictions were performed across distantly related families, prediction accuracies decreased significantly (0.47-0.48). Prediction accuracies decreased with decreasing sample size but were still high when the population size was halved (0.67-0.69). The results from this study are encouraging with respect to genome-based prediction of the genetic value of untested lines in advanced cycle breeding populations and the implementation of genomic selection in the breeding process.},

We show that the variance explained by each chromosome is proportional to its length, and that SNPs in or near genes explain more variation than SNPs between genes. We propose a new approach to estimate variation due to cryptic relatedness and population stratification.

abstract = {Background: Currently, genomic prediction in cattle is largely based on panels of about 54k single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). However with the decreasing costs of and current advances in next-generation sequencing technologies, whole-genome sequence (WGS) data on large numbers of individuals is within reach. Availability of such data provides new opportunities for genomic selection, which need to be explored. Methods: This simulation study investigated how much predictive ability is gained by using WGS data under sce- narios with QTL (quantitative trait loci) densities ranging from 45 to 132 QTL/Morgan and heritabilities ranging from 0.07 to 0.30, compared to di erent SNP densities, with emphasis on divergent dairy cattle breeds with small popula- tions. The relative performances of best linear unbiased prediction (SNP-BLUP) and of a variable selection method with a mixture of two normal distributions (MixP) were also evaluated. Genomic predictions were based on within- population, across-population, and multi-breed reference populations. Results: The use of WGS data for within-population predictions resulted in small to large increases in accuracy for low to moderately heritable traits. Depending on heritability of the trait, and on SNP and QTL densities, accuracy increased by up to 31 {\%}. The advantage of WGS data was more pronounced (7 to 92 {\%} increase in accuracy depending on trait heritability, SNP and QTL densities, and time of divergence between populations) with a combined reference popula- tion and when using MixP. While MixP outperformed SNP-BLUP at 45 QTL/Morgan, SNP-BLUP was as good as MixP when QTL density increased to 132 QTL/Morgan. Conclusions: Our results show that, genomic predictions in numerically small cattle populations would bene t from a combination of WGS data, a multi-breed reference population, and a variable selection method.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2016 The Author(s).Background: Genotype imputation is a key element of the implementation of genomic selection within the New Zealand sheep industry, but many factors can influence imputation accuracy. Our objective was to provide practical directions on the implementation of imputation strategies in a multi-breed sheep population genotyped with three single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) panels: 5K, 50K and HD (600K SNPs). Results: Imputation from 5K to HD was slightly better (0.6 {\%}) than imputation from 5K to 50K. Two-step imputation from 5K to 50K and then from 50K to HD outperformed direct imputation from 5K to HD. A slight loss in imputation accuracy was observed when a large fixed reference population was used compared to a smaller within-breed reference (including all 50K genotypes on animals from different breeds excluding those in the validation set i.e. to be imputed), but only for a few animals across all imputation scenarios from 5K to 50K. However, a major gain in imputation accuracy for a large proportion of animals (purebred and crossbred), justified the use of a fixed and large reference dataset for all situations. This study also investigated the loss in imputation accuracy specifically for SNPs located at the ends of each chromosome, and showed that only chromosome 26 had an overall imputation (5K to 50K) accuracy for 100 SNPs at each end higher than 60 {\%} (r2). Most of the chromosomes displayed reduced imputation accuracy at least at one of their ends. Prediction of imputation accuracy based on the relatedness of low-density genotypes to those of the reference dataset, before imputation (without running an imputation software) was also investigated. FIMPUTE V2.2 outperformed BEAGLE 3.3.2 across all imputation scenarios. Conclusions: Imputation accuracy in sheep breeds can be improved by following a set of recommendations on SNP panels, software, strategies of imputation (one- or two-step imputation), and choice of the animals to be genotyped using both high- and low-density SNP panels. We present a method that predicts imputation accuracy for individual animals at the low-density level, before running imputation, which can be used to restrict genomic prediction only to the animals that can be imputed with sufficient accuracy.},

abstract = {Achieving accurate genomic estimated breeding values for dairy cattle requires a very large reference population of genotyped and phenotyped individuals. Assembling such reference populations has been achieved for breeds such as Holstein, but is challenging for breeds with fewer individuals. An alternative is to use a multi-breed reference population, such that smaller breeds gain some advantage in accuracy of genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) from information from larger breeds. However, this requires that marker-quantitative trait loci associations persist across breeds. Here, we assessed the gain in accuracy of GEBV in Jersey cattle as a result of using a combined Holstein and Jersey reference population, with either 39,745 or 624,213 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. The surrogate used for accuracy was the correlation of GEBV with daughter trait deviations in a validation population. Two methods were used to predict breeding values, either a genomic BLUP (GBLUP{\_}mod), or a new method, BayesR, which used a mixture of normal distributions as the prior for SNP effects, including one distribution that set SNP effects to zero. The GBLUP{\_}mod method scaled both the genomic relationship matrix and the additive relationship matrix to a base at the time the breeds diverged, and regressed the genomic relationship matrix to account for sampling errors in estimating relationship coefficients due to a finite number of markers, before combining the 2 matrices. Although these modifications did result in less biased breeding values for Jerseys compared with an unmodified genomic relationship matrix, BayesR gave the highest accuracies of GEBV for the 3 traits investigated (milk yield, fat yield, and protein yield), with an average increase in accuracy compared with GBLUP{\_}mod across the 3 traits of 0.05 for both Jerseys and Holsteins. The advantage was limited for either Jerseys or Holsteins in using 624,213 SNP rather than 39,745 SNP (0.01 for Holsteins and 0.03 for Jerseys, averaged across traits). Even this limited and nonsignificant advantage was only observed when BayesR was used. An alternative panel, which extracted the SNP in the transcribed part of the bovine genome from the 624,213 SNP panel (to give 58,532 SNP), performed better, with an increase in accuracy of 0.03 for Jerseys across traits. This panel captures much of the increased genomic content of the 624,213 SNP panel, with the advantage of a greatly reduced number of SNP effects to estimate. Taken together, using this panel, a combined breed reference and using BayesR rather than GBLUP{\_}mod increased the accuracy of GEBV in Jerseys from 0.43 to 0.52, averaged across the 3 traits.},

abstract = {Recent advances in molecular genetic techniques will make dense marker maps available and genotyping many individuals for these markers feasible. Here we attempted to estimate the effects of approximately 50,000 marker haplotypes simultaneously from a limited number of phenotypic records. A genome of 1000 cM was simulated with a marker spacing of 1 cM. The markers surrounding every 1-cM region were combined into marker haplotypes. Due to finite population size N(e) = 100, the marker haplotypes were in linkage disequilibrium with the QTL located between the markers. Using least squares, all haplotype effects could not be estimated simultaneously. When only the biggest effects were included, they were overestimated and the accuracy of predicting genetic values of the offspring of the recorded animals was only 0.32. Best linear unbiased prediction of haplotype effects assumed equal variances associated to each 1-cM chromosomal segment, which yielded an accuracy of 0.73, although this assumption was far from true. Bayesian methods that assumed a prior distribution of the variance associated with each chromosome segment increased this accuracy to 0.85, even when the prior was not correct. It was concluded that selection on genetic values predicted from markers could substantially increase the rate of genetic gain in animals and plants, especially if combined with reproductive techniques to shorten the generation interval.},

The variants are com-mon, and they individually exhibit small-to-modest effect sizes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—In this study we investigate the combined effect of these variants and their ability to discriminate between normal weight and overweight/obese individuals. We applied receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves, and estimated the area under the ROC curve (AUC) as a measure of the discriminatory ability. The analyses were per-formed cross-sectionally in the population-based Inter99 cohort where 1,725 normal weight, 1,519 overweight, and 681 obese individuals were successfully genotyped for all 20 variants. RESULTS—When combining all variants, the 10{\%} of the study participants who carried more than 22 risk-alleles showed a significant increase in probability of being both overweight with an odds ratio of 2.00 (1.47–2.72), P ϭ 4.0 ϫ 10 Ϫ5 , and obese with an OR of 2.62 (1.76 –3.92), P ϭ 6.4 ϫ 10 Ϫ7 , compared with the 10{\%} of the study participants who carried less than 14 risk-alleles. Discrimination ability for overweight and obesity, using the 20 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), was determined to AUCs of 0.53 and 0.58, respectively. When combining SNP data with conventional nongenetic risk factors of obesity, the discrim-ination ability increased to 0.64 for overweight and 0.69 for obesity. The latter is significantly higher (P Ͻ 0.001) than for the nongenetic factors alone (AUC ϭ 0.67). CONCLUSIONS—The discriminative value of the 20 validated common obesity variants is at present time sparse and too weak for clinical utility, however, they add to increase the discrimina-tion ability of conventional nongenetic risk factors.

abstract = {Prediction of genetic risk for disease is needed for preventive and personalized medicine. Genome-wide association studies have found unprecedented numbers of variants associated with complex human traits and diseases. However, these variants explain only a small proportion of genetic risk. Mounting evidence suggests that many traits, relevant to public health, are affected by large numbers of small-effect genes and that prediction of genetic risk to those traits and diseases could be improved by incorporating large numbers of markers into whole-genome prediction (WGP) models. We developed a WGP model incorporating thousands of markers for prediction of skin cancer risk in humans. We also considered other ways of incorporating genetic information into prediction models, such as family history or ancestry (using principal components, PCs, of informative markers). Prediction accuracy was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) estimated in a cross-validation. Incorporation of genetic information (i.e., familial relationships, PCs, or WGP) yielded a significant increase in prediction accuracy: from an AUC of 0.53 for a baseline model that accounted for nongenetic covariates to AUCs of 0.58 (pedigree), 0.62 (PCs), and 0.64 (WGP). In summary, prediction of skin cancer risk could be improved by considering genetic information and using a large number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a WGP model, which allows for the detection of patterns of genetic risk that are above and beyond those that can be captured using family history. We discuss avenues for improving prediction accuracy and speculate on the possible use of WGP to prospectively identify individuals at high risk.},

abstract = {Two Bayesian methods, BayesC$\pi$ and BayesD$\pi$, were developed for genomic prediction to address the drawback of BayesA and BayesB regarding the impact of prior hyperparameters and treat the prior probability $\pi$ that a SNP has zero effect as unknown. The methods were compared in terms of inference of the number of QTL and accuracy of genomic estimated breeding values (GEBVs), using simulated scenarios and real data from North American Holstein bulls. Estimates of $\pi$ from BayesC$\pi$, in contrast to BayesD$\pi$, were sensitive to the number of simulated QTL and training data size, and provide information about genetic architecture. Milk yield and fat yield have QTL with larger effects than protein yield and somatic cell score. The drawback of BayesA and BayesB did not impair the accuracy of GEBVs. Accuracies of alternative Bayesian methods were similar. BayesA was a good choice for GEBV with the real data. Computing time was shorter for BayesC$\pi$ than for BayesD$\pi$, and longest for our implementation of BayesA. Collectively, accounting for computing effort, uncertainty as to the number of QTL (which affects the GEBV accuracy of alternative methods), and fundamental interest in the number of QTL underlying quantitative traits, we believe that BayesC$\pi$ has merit for routine applications.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016The cost of ovine pneumonia and pleurisy to the New Zealand economy is high, with the majority of loss through slower growth and reduced carcass value at slaughter. Farm management practices and vaccine development have traditionally been the main focus for prevention of pneumonia. The objective of this study was to estimate the heritability of pneumonia in New Zealand lambs, and investigate the genetic relationship with key production traits. The lungs of 11,437 lambs from pedigree-recorded flocks were scored for the presence and severity of pneumonic lesions at slaughter. On average 28{\%} of lambs had pneumonic lesions at slaughter, with 7{\%} showing severe lesions. The incidence of pleurisy in these animals was 6{\%}. Heritability estimates for pneumonic lesions and pleurisy were 0.07 ± 0.02 and 0.02 ± 0.01, respectively. There was a significant positive genetic correlation between pneumonic lesions and faecal egg count (0.30 ± 0.13). Animals with pneumonic lesions had grown faster from birth to weaning, and slower from weaning to slaughter than animals without lesions. This study has shown that there is a heritable component to pneumonia in sheep. Including more data from pedigree-recorded flocks with severe pneumonia and a high incidence of pleurisy will enable more accurate estimates of genetic parameters, and subsequent correlations with production and disease traits. This would be aided by routine recording of pneumonia in lungs at slaughter by processing plants.},

abstract = {The genomic prediction of phenotypes and breeding values in animals and plants has developed rapidly into its own research field. Results of genomic prediction studies are often difficult to compare because data simulation varies, real or simulated data are not fully described, and not all relevant results are reported. In addition, some new methods have been compared only in limited genetic architectures, leading to potentially misleading conclusions. In this article we review simulation procedures, discuss validation and reporting of results, and apply benchmark procedures for a variety of genomic prediction methods in simulated and real example data. Plant and animal breeding programs are being transformed by the use of genomic data, which are becoming widely available and cost-effective to predict genetic merit. A large number of genomic prediction studies have been published using both simulated and real data. The relative novelty of this area of research has made the development of scientific conventions difficult with regard to description of the real data, simulation of genomes, validation and reporting of results, and forward in time methods. In this review article we discuss the generation of simulated genotype and phenotype data, using approaches such as the coalescent and forward in time simulation. We outline ways to validate simulated data and genomic prediction results, including cross-validation. The accuracy and bias of genomic prediction are highlighted as performance indicators that should be reported. We suggest that a measure of relatedness between the reference and validation individuals be reported, as its impact on the accuracy of genomic prediction is substantial. A large number of methods were compared in example simulated and real (pine and wheat) data sets, all of which are publicly available. In our limited simulations, most methods performed similarly in traits with a large number of quantitative trait loci (QTL), whereas in traits with fewer QTL variable selection did have some advantages. In the real data sets examined here all methods had very similar accuracies. We conclude that no single method can serve as a benchmark for genomic prediction. We recommend comparing accuracy and bias of new methods to results from genomic best linear prediction and a variable selection approach (e.g., BayesB), because, together, these methods are appropriate for a range of genetic architectures. An accompanying article in this issue provides a comprehensive review of genomic prediction methods and discusses a selection of topics related to application of genomic prediction in plants and animals.},

Signal analysis was undertaken of six such datasets, and the resulting component sine waves used as input to an artificial neural network (ANN), a form of machine learning. By optimizing spectral features of the component sine waves, such as periodicity, amplitude and phase, the original temperature profiles were approximately simulated for the late Holocene period to 1830 CE. The ANN models were then used to generate projections of temperatures through the 20th century. The largest deviation between the ANN projections and measured temperatures for six geographically distinct regions was approximately 0.2 °C, and from this an Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS) of approximately 0.6 °C was estimated. This is considerably less than estimates from the General Circulation Models (GCMs) used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and similar to estimates from spectroscopic methods.},

abstract = {Simulation and empirical studies of genomic selection (GS) show accuracies sufficient to generate rapid gains in early selection cycles. Beyond those cycles, allele frequency changes, recombination, and inbreeding make analytical prediction of gain impossible. The impacts of GS on long-term gain should be studied prior to its implementation. A simulation case-study of this issue was done for barley, an inbred crop. On the basis of marker data on 192 breeding lines from an elite six-row spring barley program, stochastic simulation was used to explore the effects of large or small initial training populations with heritabilities of 0.2 or 0.5, applying GS before or after phenotyping, and applying additional weight on low-frequency favorable marker alleles. Genomic predictions were from ridge regression or a Bayesian analysis. Assuming that applying GS prior to phenotyping shortened breeding cycle time by 50{\%}, this practice strongly increased early selection gains but also caused the loss of many favorable QTL alleles, leading to loss of genetic variance, loss of GS accuracy, and a low selection plateau. Placing additional weight on low-frequency favorable marker alleles, however, allowed GS to increase their frequency earlier on, causing an initial increase in genetic variance. This dynamic led to higher long-term gain while mitigating losses in short-term gain. Weighted GS also increased the maintenance of marker polymorphism, ensuring that QTL-marker linkage disequilibrium was higher than in unweighted GS. Losing favorable alleles that are in weak linkage disequilibrium with markers is perhaps inevitable when using GS. Placing additional weight on low-frequency favorable alleles, however, may reduce the rate of loss of such alleles to below that of phenotypic selection. Applying such weights at the beginning of GS implementation is important.},

The objectives of our study were to investigate the impact of the parameters of each formula on the values of accuracy calculated using these formulae, and to check whether the accuracies reported in the literature are in agreement with the formulae. First, we computed the marginal distribution of accuracy (by integration) for each parameter of all four formulae: heritability h(2) , reference population size T, number of markers M and number of effective segments in the genome Me . Then, we collected 145 accuracies and corresponding parameters reported in 13 publications on genomic selection (mainly in dairy cattle), and performed analysis of variance to test the differences between observed and predicted accuracy with effects of formulae and parameters. The variation of accuracy for different values of each parameter indicated that two parameters, T and Me, had a significant impact and that considerable differences existed between the formulae (mean accuracies differed by up to 0.20 point). The results of our meta-analysis showed a big formula effect on the accuracies predicted using each formula, and also a significant effect of the value obtained for Me calculated from Ne (effective population size). Each formula can therefore be demonstrated to be optimal depending on the assumption used for Me . In conclusion, no rules can be applied to predict the reliability of genomic selection using these formulae.},

Traditional candidate gene and family-based linkage studies, which dominated gene discovery efforts for many years, were largely unsuccessful in unraveling the genetics of these traits due to the relatively limited information gained. Within the last 5 years, new advances in high-throughput methods have allowed for large volumes of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) throughout the genome to be genotyped across large and comprehensively phenotyped patient cohorts. Unlike previous approaches, these ' genome-wide association studies ' (GWAS) have extensively delivered on the promise of uncovering genetic determinants of complex diseases, with hundreds of novel disease-associated variants being largely replicated by independent groups.

abstract = {Due to the great advantages in selection accuracy and efficiency, genomic selection (GS) has been widely studied in livestock, crop and aquatic animals. Our previous study based on one full-sib family of Litopenaeus vannamei (L. vannamei) showed that GS was feasible in penaeid shrimp. However, the applicability of GS might be influenced by many factors including heritability, marker density and population structure etc. Therefore it is necessary to evaluate the major factors affecting the prediction ability of GS in shrimp. The aim of this study was to evaluate the factors influencing the GS accuracy for growth traits in L. vannamei. Genotype and phenotype data of 200 individuals from 13 full-sib families were used for this analysis. In the present study, the heritability of growth traits in L. vannamei was estimated firstly based on the full set of markers (23 K). It was 0.321 for body weight and 0.452 for body length. The estimated heritability increased rapidly with the increase of the marker density from 0.05 K to 3.2 K, and then it tended to be stable for both traits. For genomic prediction on the growth traits in L. vannamei, three statistic models (RR-BLUP, BayesA and Bayesian LASSO) showed similar performance for the prediction accuracy of genomic estimated breeding value (GEBV). The prediction accuracy was improved with the increasing of marker density. However, the marker density would bring a weak effect on the prediction accuracy after the marker number reached 3.2 K. In addition, the genetic relationship between reference and validation population could influence the GS accuracy significantly. A distant genetic relationship between reference and validation population resulted in a poor performance of genomic prediction for growth traits in L. vannamei. For the growth traits with moderate or high heritability, such as body weight and body length, the number of about 3.2 K SNPs distributed evenly along the genome was able to satisfy the need for accurate GS prediction in the investigated L.vannamei population. The genetic relationship between the reference population and the validation population showed significant effects on the accuracy for genomic prediction. Therefore it is very important to optimize the design of the reference population when applying GS to shrimp breeding.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION Over the last few years, methods based on suffix arrays using the Burrows-Wheeler Transform have been widely used for DNA sequence read matching and assembly. These provide very fast search algorithms, linear in the search pattern size, on a highly compressible representation of the dataset being searched. Meanwhile, algorithmic development for genotype data has concentrated on statistical methods for phasing and imputation, based on probabilistic matching to hidden Markov model representations of the reference data, which while powerful are much less computationally efficient. Here a theory of haplotype matching using suffix array ideas is developed, which should scale too much larger datasets than those currently handled by genotype algorithms. RESULTS Given M sequences with N bi-allelic variable sites, an O(NM) algorithm to derive a representation of the data based on positional prefix arrays is given, which is termed the positional Burrows-Wheeler transform (PBWT). On large datasets this compresses with run-length encoding by more than a factor of a hundred smaller than using gzip on the raw data. Using this representation a method is given to find all maximal haplotype matches within the set in O(NM) time rather than O(NM(2)) as expected from naive pairwise comparison, and also a fast algorithm, empirically independent of M given sufficient memory for indexes, to find maximal matches between a new sequence and the set. The discussion includes some proposals about how these approaches could be used for imputation and phasing.},

@article{Stranden2009,
abstract = {Two types of models have been used for single-step genomic prediction and genome-wide association studies that include phenotypes from both genotyped animals and their non-genotyped relatives. The two types are breeding value models (BVM) that fit breeding values explicitly and marker effects models (MEM) that express the breeding values in terms of the effects of observed or imputed genotypes. MEM can accommodate a wider class of analyses, including variable selection or mixture model analyses. The order of the equations that need to be solved and the inverses required in their construction vary widely, and thus the computational effort required depends upon the size of the pedigree, the number of genotyped animals and the number of loci. We present computational strategies to avoid storing large, dense blocks of the MME that involve imputed genotypes. Furthermore, we present a hybrid model that fits a MEM for animals with observed genotypes and a BVM for those without genotypes. The hybrid model is computationally attractive for pedigree files containing millions of animals with a large proportion of those being genotyped. We demonstrate the practicality on both the original MEM and the hybrid model using real data with 6,179,960 animals in the pedigree with 4,934,101 phenotypes and 31,453 animals genotyped at 40,214 informative loci. To complete a single-trait analysis on a desk-top computer with four graphics cards required about 3 h using the hybrid model to obtain both preconditioned conjugate gradient solutions and 42,000 Markov chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) samples of breeding values, which allowed making inferences from posterior means, variances and covariances. The MCMC sampling required one quarter of the effort when the hybrid model was used compared to the published MEM. We present a hybrid model that fits a MEM for animals with genotypes and a BVM for those without genotypes. Its practicality and considerable reduction in computing effort was demonstrated. This model can readily be extended to accommodate multiple traits, multiple breeds, maternal effects, and additional random effects such as polygenic residual effects.},

Where is the remaining heritability? We estimated the proportion of variance for human height explained by 294,831 SNPs genotyped on 3,925 unrelated individuals using a linear model analysis, and validated the estimation method with simulations based on the observed genotype data. We show that 45{\%} of variance can be explained by considering all SNPs simultaneously. Thus, most of the heritability is not missing but has not previously been detected because the individual effects are too small to pass stringent significance tests. We provide evidence that the remaining heritability is due to incomplete linkage disequilibrium between causal variants and genotyped SNPs, exacerbated by causal variants having lower minor allele frequency than the SNPs explored to date.},

abstract = {A new technology called genomic selection is revolutionizing dairy cattle breeding. Genomic selection refers to selection decisions based on genomic breeding values (GEBV). The GEBV are calculated as the sum of the effects of dense genetic markers, or haplotypes of these markers, across the entire genome, thereby potentially capturing all the quantitative trait loci (QTL) that contribute to variation in a trait. The QTL effects, inferred from either haplotypes or individual single nucleotide polymorphism markers, are first estimated in a large reference population with phenotypic information. In subsequent generations, only marker information is required to calculate GEBV. The reliability of GEBV predicted in this way has already been evaluated in experiments in the United States, New Zealand, Australia, and the Netherlands. These experiments used reference populations of between 650 and 4,500 progeny-tested Holstein-Friesian bulls, genotyped for approximately 50,000 genome-wide markers. Reliabilities of GEBV for young bulls without progeny test results in the reference population were between 20 and 67{\%}. The reliability achieved depended on the heritability of the trait evaluated, the number of bulls in the reference population, the statistical method used to estimate the single nucleotide polymorphism effects in the reference population, and the method used to calculate the reliability. A common finding in 3 countries (United States, New Zealand, and Australia) was that a straightforward BLUP method for estimating the marker effects gave reliabilities of GEBV almost as high as more complex methods. The BLUP method is attractive because the only prior information required is the additive genetic variance of the trait. All countries included a polygenic effect (parent average breeding value) in their GEBV calculation. This inclusion is recommended to capture any genetic variance not associated with the markers, and to put some selection pressure on low-frequency QTL that may not be captured by the markers. The reliabilities of GEBV achieved were significantly greater than the reliability of parental average breeding values, the current criteria for selection of bull calves to enter progeny test teams. The increase in reliability is sufficiently high that at least 2 dairy breeding companies are already marketing bull teams for commercial use based on their GEBV only, at 2 yr of age. This strategy should at least double the rate of genetic gain in the dairy industry. Many challenges with genomic selection and its implementation remain, including increasing the accuracy of GEBV, integrating genomic information into national and international genetic evaluations, and managing long-term genetic gain.},

Here we report a user-friendly software tool called genome-wide complex trait analysis (GCTA), which was developed based on a method we recently developed to address the "missing heritability" problem. GCTA estimates the variance explained by all the SNPs on a chromosome or on the whole genome for a complex trait rather than testing the association of any particular SNP to the trait. We introduce GCTA's five main functions: data management, estimation of the genetic relationships from SNPs, mixed linear model analysis of variance explained by the SNPs, estimation of the linkage disequilibrium structure, and GWAS simulation. We focus on the function of estimating the variance explained by all the SNPs on the X chromosome and testing the hypotheses of dosage compensation. The GCTA software is a versatile tool to estimate and partition complex trait variation with large GWAS data sets.},

abstract = {Molecular markers have been used to map quantitative trait loci. However, they are rarely used to evaluate effects of chromosome segments of the entire genome. The original interval-mapping approach and various modified versions of it may have limited use in evaluating the genetic effects of the entire genome because they require evaluation of multiple models and model selection. Here we present a Bayesian regression method to simultaneously estimate genetic effects associated with markers of the entire genome. With the Bayesian method, we were able to handle situations in which the number of effects is even larger than the number of observations. The key to the success is that we allow each marker effect to have its own variance parameter, which in turn has its own prior distribution so that the variance can be estimated from the data. Under this hierarchical model, we were able to handle a large number of markers and most of the markers may have negligible effects. As a result, it is possible to evaluate the distribution of the marker effects. Using data from the North American Barley Genome Mapping Project in double-haploid barley, we found that the distribution of gene effects follows closely an L-shaped Gamma distribution, which is in contrast to the bell-shaped Gamma distribution when the gene effects were estimated from interval mapping. In addition, we show that the Bayesian method serves as an alternative or even better QTL mapping method because it produces clearer signals for QTL. Similar results were found from simulated data sets of F(2) and backcross (BC) families.},

Here, we instead explore the paradigm of reference-based phasing. We introduce a new phasing algorithm, Eagle2, that attains high accuracy across a broad range of cohort sizes by efficiently leveraging information from large external reference panels (such as the Haplotype Reference Consortium, HRC) using a new data structure based on the positional Burrows-Wheeler transform. We demonstrate that Eagle2 attains a ≈20x speedup and ≈10{\%} increase in accuracy compared to reference-based phasing using SHAPEIT2. On European-ancestry samples, Eagle2 with the HRC panel achieves {\textgreater}2x the accuracy of 1000 Genomes-based phasing. Eagle2 is open source and freely available for HRC-based phasing via the Sanger Imputation Service and the Michigan Imputation Server.},

abstract = {In genome-wide association studies, failure to remove variation due to population structure results in spurious associations. In contrast, for predictions of future phenotypes or estimated breeding values from dense SNP data, exploiting population structure arising from relatedness can actually increase the accuracy of prediction in some cases, for example, when the selection candidates are offspring of the reference population where the prediction equation was derived. In populations with large effective population size or with ultiple breeds and strains, it has not been demonstrated whether and when accounting for or removing variation due to population structure will affect the accuracy of genomic prediction. Our aim in this study was to determine whether accounting for population structure would increase the accuracy of genomic predictions, both within and across breeds. First, we have attempted to decompose the accuracy of genomic prediction into contributions from population structure or linkage disequilibrium (LD) between markers and QTL using a diverse multi-breed sheep (Ovis aries) data set, genotyped for 48,640 SNP. We demonstrate that SNP from a single chromosome can achieve up to 86{\%} of the accuracy for genomic predictions using all SNP. This result suggests that most of the prediction accuracy is due to population structure, because a single chromosome is expected to capture relationships but is unlikely to contain all QTL. We then explored principal component analysis (PCA) as an approach to disentangle the respective contributions of population structure and LD between SNP and QTL to the accuracy of genomic predictions. Results showed that fitting an increasing number of principle components (PC; as covariates) decreased within breed accuracy until a lower plateau was reached. We speculate that this plateau is a measure of the accuracy due to LD. In conclusion, a large proportion of the accuracy for genomic predictions in our data was due to variation associated with population structure. Surprisingly, accounting for this structure generally decreased the accuracy of across brT]eed genomic predictions. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract = {Mitochondrial function is altered with age and variants in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) modulate risk for several age-related disease states. However, the association of mtDNA copy number, a readily available marker which reflects mitochondrial depletion, energy reserves, and oxidative stress, on aging and mortality in the general population has not been addressed. To assess the association between mtDNA copy number and two primary outcomes--prevalent frailty and all-cause mortality--we utilize data from participants who were from two multicenter, multiethnic, community-based, prospective studies--the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) (1989-2006) and the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study (1987-2013). A total of 4892 participants (43.3{\%} men) from CHS and 11,509 participants (44.9{\%} men) from ARIC self-identifying as white or black were included in the analysis. mtDNA copy number, the trait of interest, was measured using a qPCR-based method in CHS and an array-based method in ARIC from DNA isolated from whole blood in participants from both cohorts. In race-stratified meta-analyses, we observe a significant inverse association of mtDNA copy number with age and higher mtDNA copy number in women relative to men. Lower mtDNA copy number was also significantly associated with prevalent frailty in white participants from CHS (OR 0.91, 95{\%} CI 0.85-0.97). Additionally, mtDNA copy number was a strong independent predictor of all-cause mortality in an age- and sex-adjusted, race-stratified analysis of 16,401 participants from both cohorts with a pooled hazard ratio of 1.47 (95{\%} CI 1.33-1.62) for the lowest quintile of mtDNA copy number relative to the highest quintile. Key messages: Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number is associated with age and sex. Lower mtDNA copy number is also associated with prevalent frailty. mtDNA copy number is a significant predictor of all-cause mortality in a multiethnic population.},

abstract = {The genetics of early conception success and live-animal growth were studied in five herds of red deer in New Zealand. Conception date (CD) was used as the criterion of success in seasonally mated hinds, with 2493 mating records available. Liveweights analysed were weaning weight, yearling weight, 15-month weight and mature weight (hinds only). CD and liveweights were analysed using restricted maximum likelihood procedures with an animal model, including all available pedigree records. Under the management conditions applied, CD had a phenotypic standard deviation of 7.9 days, a repeatability across years of 0.29 ± 0.03 and a direct (univariate) heritability of 0.20 ± 0.06. Regression procedures using DNA markers to adjust the data for genetic differences resulting from an animal's ancestral region of origin (mainly western vs eastern European) had little effect on the parameter estimates above. Direct heritability estimates for the four weight traits were 0.38 ± 0.03, 0.49 ± 0.02, 0.48 ± 0.04 and 0.46 ± 0.04, respectively, while the genetic correlations between CD and these traits (e.g. using 1763 paired records of CD with yearling weight) were -0.24 ± 0.11, -0.24 ± 0.09, -0.16 ± 0.10 and -0.04 ± 0.09, respectively. Selection for earlier CD would be successful and compatible with selection for higher juvenile weights. {\textcopyright} CSIRO 2013.},

abstract = {In genomewide selection, the expected correlation between predicted performance and true genotypic value is a function of the training population size (N), heritability on an entry-mean basis (h2), and effective number of chromosome segments underlying the trait (Me). Our objectives were to (i) determine how the prediction accuracy of different traits responds to changes in N, h2, and number of markers (NM) and (ii) determine if prediction accuracy is equal across traits if N, h2, and NM are kept constant. In a simulated population and four empirical populations in maize (Zea mays L.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), we added random nongenetic effects to the phenotypic data to reduce h2 to 0.50, 0.30 and 0.20. As expected, increasing N, h2, and NM increased prediction accuracy. For the same trait within the same population, prediction accuracy was constant for different combinations of N and h2 that led to the same Nh2. Different traits, however, varied in their prediction accuracy even when N, h2, and NM were constant. Yield traits had lower prediction accuracy than other traits despite the constant N, h2, and NM. Empirical evidence and experience on the predictability of different traits are needed in designing training populations},

abstract = {The prediction of phenotypic traits using high-density genomic data has many applications such as the selection of plants and animals of commercial interest; and it is expected to play an increasing role in medical diagnostics. Statistical models used for this task are usually tested using cross-validation, which implicitly assumes that new individuals (whose pheno-types we would like to predict) originate from the same population the genomic prediction model is trained on. In this paper we propose an approach based on clustering and resam-pling to investigate the effect of increasing genetic distance between training and target populations when predicting quantitative traits. This is important for plant and animal genet-ics, where genomic selection programs rely on the precision of predictions in future rounds of breeding. Therefore, estimating how quickly predictive accuracy decays is important in deciding which training population to use and how often the model has to be recalibrated. We find that the correlation between true and predicted values decays approximately line-arly with respect to either F ST or mean kinship between the training and the target popula-tions. We illustrate this relationship using simulations and a collection of data sets from mice, wheat and human genetics. Author Summary The availability of increasing amounts of genomic data is making the use of statistical models to predict traits of interest a mainstay of many applications in life sciences. Appli-cations range from medical diagnostics for common and rare diseases to breeding charac-teristics such as disease resistance in plants and animals of commercial interest. We explored an implicit assumption of how such prediction models are often assessed: that the individuals whose traits we would like to predict originate from the same population as those that are used to train the models. This is commonly not the case, especially in the case of plants and animals that are parts of selection programs. To study this problem we proposed a model-agnostic approach to infer the accuracy of prediction models as a func-tion of two common measures of genetic distance.

abstract = {The important parameter of effective population size is rarely estimable directly from demographic data. Indirect estimates of effective population size may be made from genetic data such as temporal variation of allelic frequencies or linkage disequilibrium in cohorts. We suggest here that an indirect estimate of the effective number of breeders might be based on the excess of heterozygosity expected in a cohort of progeny produced by a limited number of males and females. In computer simulations, heterozygote excesses for 30 unlinked loci having various numbers of alleles and allele-frequency profiles were obtained for cohorts produced by samples of breeders drawn form an age-structured population and having known variance in reproductive success and effective number. The 95{\%} confidence limits around the estimate contained the true effective population size in 70 of 72 trials and the Spearman rank correlation of estimated and actual values was 0.991. An estimate based on the heterozygote excess might have certain advantages over the previous estimates, requiring only single-locus and single-cohort data, but the sampling error among individuals and the effect of departures from random union of gametes still need to be explored.},

Recent technological and statistical advances have enabled the estimation of additive heritability attributable to common genetic variants (SNP heritability) across a broad phenotypic spectrum. Here, we present a computationally and memory efficient heritability estimation method that can handle large sample sizes, and report the SNP heritability for 551 complex traits derived from the interim data release (152,736 subjects) of the large-scale, population-based UK Biobank, comprising both quantitative phenotypes and disease codes. We demonstrate that common genetic variation contributes to a broad array of quantitative traits and human diseases in the UK population, and identify phenotypes whose heritability is moderated by age (e.g., a majority of physical measures including height and body mass index), sex (e.g., blood pressure related traits) and socioeconomic status (education). Our study represents the first comprehensive phenome-wide heritability analysis in the UK Biobank, and underscores the importance of considering population characteristics in interpreting heritability.},

abstract = {Utilizing the whole genomic variation of complex traits to predict the yet-to-be observed phenotypes or unobserved genetic values via whole genome prediction (WGP) and to infer the underlying genetic architecture via genome wide association study (GWAS) is an interesting and fast developing area in the context of human disease studies as well as in animal and plant breeding. Though thousands of significant loci for several species were detected via GWAS in the past decade, they were not used directly to improve WGP due to lack of proper models. Here, we propose a generalized way of building trait-specific genomic relationship matrices which can exploit GWAS results in WGP via a best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) model for which we suggest the name BLUP|GA. Results from two illustrative examples show that using already existing GWAS results from public databases in BLUP|GA improved the accuracy of WGP for two out of the three model traits in a dairy cattle data set, and for nine out of the 11 traits in a rice diversity data set, compared to the reference methods GBLUP and BayesB. While BLUP|GA outperforms BayesB, its required computing time is comparable to GBLUP. Further simulation results suggest that accounting for publicly available GWAS results is potentially more useful for WGP utilizing smaller data sets and/or traits of low heritability, depending on the genetic architecture of the trait under consideration. To our knowledge, this is the first study incorporating public GWAS results formally into the standard GBLUP model and we think that the BLUP|GA approach deserves further investigations in animal breeding, plant breeding as well as human genetics.},

abstract = {Genomic selection is focused on prediction of breeding values of selection candidates by means of high density of markers. It relies on the assumption that all quantitative trait loci (QTLs) tend to be in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) with at least one marker. In this con-text, we present theoretical results regarding the accuracy of genomic selection, i.e., the correlation between predicted and true breeding values. Typically, for individuals (so-called test individuals), breeding values are predicted by means of markers, using marker effects estimated by fitting a ridge regression model to a set of training individuals. We present a theoretical expression for the accuracy; this expression is suitable for any configurations of LD between QTLs and markers. We also introduce a new accuracy proxy that is free of the QTL parameters and easily computable; it outperforms the proxies suggested in the litera-ture, in particular, those based on an estimated effective number of independent loci (M e). The theoretical formula, the new proxy, and existing proxies were compared for simulated data, and the results point to the validity of our approach. The calculations were also illus-trated on a new perennial ryegrass set (367 individuals) genotyped for 24,957 single nucleo-tide polymorphisms (SNPs). In this case, most of the proxies studied yielded similar results because of the lack of markers for coverage of the entire genome (2.7 Gb).},

GS estimates the effect of thousands of DNA markers simultaneously. Nonlinear estimation methods yield higher accuracy, especially for traits with major genes. The marker effects are estimated in a genotyped and phenotyped training population and are used for the estimation of breeding values of selection candidates by combining their genotypes with the estimated marker effects. The benefits of GS are greatest when selection is for traits that are not themselves recorded on the selection candidates before they can be selected. In the future, genome sequence data may replace SNP genotypes as markers. This could increase GS accuracy because the causative mutations should be included in the data.},

Several useful approaches to accomplish genomic prediction have been developed and used widely, but still have room for improvement to gain more accuracy. In this study, an improved Bayesian approach, termed BayesB$\pi$, which differs from the original BayesB in priors assigning, is proposed. An effective method for calculating the locus-specific $\pi$ by converting p-values from association between SNPs and traits' phenotypes is given and systemically validated using a German Holstein dairy cattle population. Furthermore, the new method is applied to a loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) dataset. Results: Compared with the original BayesB, BayesB$\pi$ can improve the accuracy of genomic prediction up to 7.62 {\%} for milk fat percentage, a trait which shows a large effect of quantitative trait loci (QTL). For milk yield, which is controlled by small to moderate effect genes, the accuracy of genomic prediction can be improved up to 4.94 {\%}. For somatic cell score, of which no large effect QTL has been reported, GBLUP performs better than Bayesian methods. BayesB$\pi$ outperforms BayesC$\pi$ in 10 out of 12 scenarios in the dairy cattle population, especially in small to moderate population sizes where accuracy of BayesC$\pi$ are dramatically low. Results of the loblolly pine dataset show that BayesB$\pi$ outperforms BayesB in 14 out of 17 traits and BayesC$\pi$ in 8 out of 17 traits, respectively. Conclusions: For traits controlled by large effect genes, BayesB$\pi$ can improve the accuracy of genomic prediction and unbiasedness of BayesB in moderate size populations. Knowledge of traits' genetic architectures can be integrated into practices of genomic prediction by assigning locus-specific priors to markers, which will help Bayesian approaches perform better in variable selection and marker effects shrinkage.},

abstract = {A central goal of genetics is to understand the links between genetic variation and disease. Intuitively, one might expect disease-causing variants to cluster into key pathways that drive disease etiology. But for complex traits, association signals tend to be spread across most of the genome-including near many genes without an obvious connection to disease. We propose that gene regulatory networks are sufficiently interconnected such that all genes expressed in disease-relevant cells are liable to affect the functions of core disease-related genes and that most heritability can be explained by effects on genes outside core pathways. We refer to this hypothesis as an "omnigenic" model.},

abstract = {Although the concept of genomic selection relies on linkage disequilibrium (LD) between quantitative trait loci and markers, reliability of genomic predictions is strongly influenced by family relationships. In this study, we investigated the effects of LD and family relationships on reliability of genomic predictions and the potential of deterministic formulas to predict reliability using population parameters in populations with complex family structures. Five groups of selection candidates were simulated by taking different information sources from the reference population into account: (1) allele frequencies, (2) LD pattern, (3) haplotypes, (4) haploid chromosomes, and (5) individuals from the reference population, thereby having real family relationships with reference individuals. Reliabilities were predicted using genomic relationships among 529 reference individuals and their relationships with selection candidates and with a deterministic formula where the number of effective chromosome segments (M(e)) was estimated based on genomic and additive relationship matrices for each scenario. At a heritability of 0.6, reliabilities based on genomic relationships were 0.002 ± 0.0001 (allele frequencies), 0.022 ± 0.001 (LD pattern), 0.018 ± 0.001 (haplotypes), 0.100 ± 0.008 (haploid chromosomes), and 0.318 ± 0.077 (family relationships). At a heritability of 0.1, relative differences among groups were similar. For all scenarios, reliabilities were similar to predictions with a deterministic formula using estimated M(e). So, reliabilities can be predicted accurately using empirically estimated M(e) and level of relationship with reference individuals has a much higher effect on the reliability than linkage disequilibrium per se. Furthermore, accumulated length of shared haplotypes is more important in determining the reliability of genomic prediction than the individual shared haplotype length.},

abstract = {Type 2 diabetes (T2D) has become a leading health problem throughout the world. It is caused by environmental and genetic factors, as well as interactions between the two. However, until very recently, the T2D susceptibility genes have been poorly understood. During the past 5 years, with the advent of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), a total of 58 T2D susceptibility loci have been associated with T2D risk at a genome-wide significance level (P {\textless} 5 × 10(-8) ), with evidence showing that most of these genetic variants influence pancreatic $\beta$-cell function. Most novel T2D susceptibility loci were identified through GWAS in European populations and later confirmed in other ethnic groups. Although the recent discovery of novel T2D susceptibility loci has contributed substantially to our understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease, the clinical utility of these loci in disease prediction and prognosis is limited. More studies using multi-ethnic meta-analysis, gene-environment interaction analysis, sequencing analysis, epigenetic analysis, and functional experiments are needed to identify new susceptibility T2D loci and causal variants, and to establish biological mechanisms.},

Variable selection is a key to both of these tasks as it allows to (1) detect clear mapping signals of QTL activity, and (2) predict the genome-enhanced breeding values accurately. In this paper, we provide an overview of a statistical method called least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and two of its generalizations named elastic net and adaptive LASSO in the contexts of QTL mapping and genomic breeding value prediction in plants (or animals). We also briefly summarize the Bayesian interpretation of LASSO, and the inspired hierarchical Bayesian models. We illustrate the implementation and examine the performance of methods using three public data sets: (1) North American barley data with 127 individuals and 145 markers, (2) a simulated QTLMAS XII data with 5,865 individuals and 6,000 markers for both QTL mapping and genomic selection, and (3) a wheat data with 599 individuals and 1,279 markers only for genomic selection.},

@article{Ogutu2012,
abstract = {BACKGROUND Genomic selection (GS) is emerging as an efficient and cost-effective method for estimating breeding values using molecular markers distributed over the entire genome. In essence, it involves estimating the simultaneous effects of all genes or chromosomal segments and combining the estimates to predict the total genomic breeding value (GEBV). Accurate prediction of GEBVs is a central and recurring challenge in plant and animal breeding. The existence of a bewildering array of approaches for predicting breeding values using markers underscores the importance of identifying approaches able to efficiently and accurately predict breeding values. Here, we comparatively evaluate the predictive performance of six regularized linear regression methods-- ridge regression, ridge regression BLUP, lasso, adaptive lasso, elastic net and adaptive elastic net-- for predicting GEBV using dense SNP markers. METHODS We predicted GEBVs for a quantitative trait using a dataset on 3000 progenies of 20 sires and 200 dams and an accompanying genome consisting of five chromosomes with 9990 biallelic SNP-marker loci simulated for the QTL-MAS 2011 workshop. We applied all the six methods that use penalty-based (regularization) shrinkage to handle datasets with far more predictors than observations. The lasso, elastic net and their adaptive extensions further possess the desirable property that they simultaneously select relevant predictive markers and optimally estimate their effects. The regression models were trained with a subset of 2000 phenotyped and genotyped individuals and used to predict GEBVs for the remaining 1000 progenies without phenotypes. Predictive accuracy was assessed using the root mean squared error, the Pearson correlation between predicted GEBVs and (1) the true genomic value (TGV), (2) the true breeding value (TBV) and (3) the simulated phenotypic values based on fivefold cross-validation (CV). RESULTS The elastic net, lasso, adaptive lasso and the adaptive elastic net all had similar accuracies but outperformed ridge regression and ridge regression BLUP in terms of the Pearson correlation between predicted GEBVs and the true genomic value as well as the root mean squared error. The performance of RR-BLUP was also somewhat better than that of ridge regression. This pattern was replicated by the Pearson correlation between predicted GEBVs and the true breeding values (TBV) and the root mean squared error calculated with respect to TBV, except that accuracy was lower for all models, most especially for the adaptive elastic net. The correlation between the predicted GEBV and simulated phenotypic values based on the fivefold CV also revealed a similar pattern except that the adaptive elastic net had lower accuracy than both the ridge regression methods. CONCLUSIONS All the six models had relatively high prediction accuracies for the simulated data set. Accuracy was higher for the lasso type methods than for ridge regression and ridge regression BLUP.},

abstract = {We explore the prediction of individuals' phenotypes for complex traits using genomic data. We compare several widely used prediction models, including Ridge Regression, LASSO and Elastic Nets estimated from cohort data, and polygenic risk scores constructed using published summary statistics from genome-wide association meta-analyses (GWAMA). We evaluate the interplay between relatedness, trait architecture and optimal marker density, by predicting height, body mass index (BMI) and high-density lipoprotein level (HDL) in two data cohorts, originating from Croatia and Scotland. We empirically demonstrate that dense models are better when all genetic effects are small (height and BMI) and target individuals are related to the training samples, while sparse models predict better in unrelated individuals and when some effects have moderate size (HDL). For HDL sparse models achieved good across-cohort prediction, performing similarly to the GWAMA risk score and to models trained within the same cohort, which indicates that, for predicting traits with moderately sized effects, large sample sizes and familial structure become less important, though still potentially useful. Finally, we propose a novel ensemble of whole-genome predictors with GWAMA risk scores and demonstrate that the resulting meta-model achieves higher prediction accuracy than either model on its own. We conclude that although current genomic predictors are not accurate enough for diagnostic purposes, performance can be improved without requiring access to large-scale individual-level data. Our methodologically simple meta-model is a means of performing predictive meta-analysis for optimizing genomic predictions and can be easily extended to incorporate multiple population-level summary statistics or other domain knowledge.},

However, recent advances in machine learning, for example, iterative sure independence screening, make it possible to analyze data sets with vastly more predictors than observations. Using an implementation of the sure independence screening algorithm (called EPISIS), we performed a genome-wide interaction analysis testing all possible SNP-SNP interactions affecting regional brain volumes measured on magnetic resonance imaging and mapped using tensor-based morphometry. We identified a significant SNP-SNP interaction between rs1345203 and rs1213205 that explains 1.9{\%} of the variance in temporal lobe volume. We mapped the whole brain, voxelwise effects of the interaction in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data set and separately in an independent replication data set of healthy twins (Queensland Twin Imaging). Each additional loading in the interaction effect was associated with approximately 5{\%} greater brain regional brain volume (a protective effect) in both Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and Queensland Twin Imaging samples.},

abstract = {Compared to univariate analysis of genome-wide association (GWA) studies, machine learning–based models have been shown to provide improved means of learning such multilocus panels of genetic variants and their interactions that are most predictive of complex phenotypic traits. Many applications of predictive modeling rely on effective variable selection, often implemented through model regularization, which penalizes the model complexity and enables predictions in individuals outside of the training dataset. However, the different regularization approaches may also lead to considerable differences, especially in the number of genetic variants needed for maximal predictive accuracy, as illustrated here in examples from both disease classification and quantitative trait prediction. We also highlight the potential pitfalls of the regularized machine learning models, related to issues such as model overfitting to the training data, which may lead to overoptimistic prediction results, as well as identifiability of the predictive variants, which is important in many medical applications. While genetic risk prediction for human diseases is used as a motivating use case, we argue that these models are also widely applicable in nonhuman applications, such as animal and plant breeding, where accurate genotype-to-phenotype modeling is needed. Finally, we discuss some key future advances, open questions and challenges in this developing field, when moving toward low-frequency variants and cross-phenotype interactions.},

Algorithms were derived and computer programs tested with simulated data for 2,967 bulls and 50,000 markers distributed randomly across 30 chromosomes. Estimation of genomic inbreeding coef-ficients required accurate estimates of allele frequen-cies in the base population. Linear model predictions of breeding values were computed by 3 equivalent meth-ods: 1) iteration for individual allele effects followed by summation across loci to obtain estimated breeding values, 2) selection index including a genomic relation-ship matrix, and 3) mixed model equations including the inverse of genomic relationships. A blend of first-and second-order Jacobi iteration using 2 separate relaxation factors converged well for allele frequencies and effects. Reliability of predicted net merit for young bulls was 63{\%} compared with 32{\%} using the tradi-tional relationship matrix. Nonlinear predictions were also computed using iteration on data and nonlinear regression on marker deviations; an additional (about 3{\%}) gain in reliability for young bulls increased average reliability to 66{\%}. Computing times increased linearly with number of genotypes. Estimation of allele frequen-cies required 2 processor days, and genomic predictions required {\textless}1 d per trait, and traits were processed in parallel. Information from genotyping was equivalent to about 20 daughters with phenotypic records. Actual gains may differ because the simulation did not ac-count for linkage disequilibrium in the base population or selection in subsequent generations.},
