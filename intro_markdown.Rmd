## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

# Palmer Penguins

We are going to use a dataset 

```{r penguins}
head(penguins)
```

```{r count}
penguins %>% 
  count(species) %>% 
  kable(caption = "Species Counts")
```


we can generate more elegent tables with [kableExtra](https://haozhu233.github.io/kableExtra/awesome_table_in_html.html#overview)

```{r kableextra}
penguins %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarize(across(where(is.numeric), mean, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  kable(caption = "Summarized Data", format = "html") %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), full_width = F, position = "left")
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r mass-flipper-simple}
mass_flipper <- ggplot(data = penguins, 
                       aes(x = flipper_length_mm,
                           y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species, 
                 shape = species))
mass_flipper
```
```{r mass-flipper-detailed}
mass_flipper2 <- ggplot(data = penguins, 
                       aes(x = flipper_length_mm,
                           y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species, 
                 shape = species),
             size = 3,
             alpha = 0.8) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  labs(title = "Penguin size, Palmer Station LTER",
       subtitle = "Flipper length and body mass for Adelie, Chinstrap and Gentoo Penguins",
       x = "Flipper length (mm)",
       y = "Body mass (g)",
       color = "Penguin species",
       shape = "Penguin species") +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.2, 0.7),
        legend.background = element_rect(fill = "white", color = NA),
        plot.title.position = "plot",
        plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, face= "italic"),
        plot.caption.position = "plot")
mass_flipper2
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
flipper_hist <- ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = species), 
                 alpha = 0.5, 
                 position = "identity") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Flipper length (mm)",
       y = "Frequency",
       title = "Penguin flipper lengths")
flipper_hist
```

```{r}
citation("palmerpenguins")
```
